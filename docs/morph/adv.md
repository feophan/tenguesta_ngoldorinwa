# Adverbs

## Formation of Adverbs

### Introduction

Nearly all adverbs derive from original case-forms of an adjective or noun.

+ Frequently an adjective can be used where in English an adverb is required: EXAMPLES;
+ In numerous cases adverbs are zero-derived from abstract nouns: EXAMPLES;
+ Chief among the suffixes developped specifically for forming adverbs is `-o`; this suffix was freely added (i.e. it was productive) to the stems of adjectives to create manner adverbs, e.g. adv. `ando`, with the adj. `anda`. &rarr; @@.
+ Less productive, but still widely used, were various endings indicating various local relationships, e.g. -da/-r (indicating place to which), -lo (indicating place from which), etc. &rarr; @@.


A few adverbs did not originate as case forms of a noun or adjective. Some of these are treated below. For adverbs formed from (the stems of) pronouns (e.g. ???), &rarr; @@. For adverbs formed from numerals (usually in `-lume`), &rarr; @@.

### Manner Adverbs in -ve

The productive adverbial suffix `-ve` formed primarily adverbs of manner.The suffix is added directly to the stem.
