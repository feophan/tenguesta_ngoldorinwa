## Basic Categories and Elements

### Categories of the Verb

#### Finite versus Non-finite Verb Forms

Quenya verb forms are either **finite** (indicatives, subjunctives, optatives, imperatives) or **non-finite** (gerunds, infinitives, participles, and verbal adjectives in `-nwa`, `-ite` or `-ima`). Finite verbs can have a personal ending (@@) and express person or number, and can be modified by mood particles; nonfinite verbs do not have a personal ending and do not express person or mood.

#### Categories Pertaining to All Verb Forms: Tense-Aspect

All Quenya verb forms, i.e. both finite and non-finite forms (only participles), are marked for the category of **tense-aspect**.

**Tense-aspect**: Quenya verb forms fall into three overarching systems, depending on which stem of the verb is used (@@); these three systems differ primarily in their expression of aspect:

+ the **aorist-stem system**, covering the aorist, the preterite, the future, present active and passive participles;
+ the **present-stem system**, covering the present and the imperfect;
+ and the **perfect-stem system**, covering the perfect, the past active and passive participles.

Within these systems, **tense** is expressed by all forms. Aspect is not expressed by participles.

#### Categories Pertaining to Finite Verb Forms

All finite verb forms, in addition to belonging to one of the three tense-aspect systems, are also marked for the categories of **person** and **number**, and the category of **mood**.

Finite verb forms express one of the following **persons**:

+ **apersonal form** (used with expressed subject, @@);
+ **first person** ('I'/'we (but not you)'/'we (with you)');
+ **second person** ('you');
+ or **third person**('he/she'/'it', 'they');

And they express one of the following **numbers**:

+ **singular** ('I', 'you', 'he/she'/'it');
+ **plural** ('we (but not you)'/'we (with you)', 'you', 'they');
+ in addition, Quenya has a **dual number** ('you and I', 'you two','the two of them', @@).

Finite verb forms do not express **moods**, and those are realized as mood particles preceeding the verb (for the uses and meanings of these moods, @@). The following moods are recongnized:

+ **indicative**;
+ **subjunctive**;
+ **optative**;
+ **imperative**.

Finally, indicative forms can be split into **basic forms** (aorist, present, preterite, imperfect, perfect, future) and **derivative forms** (future perfect, future imperfect, long perfect (perfect continuous), pluperfect, future-in-the-past).

!!! danger "Controversial"
	Derivative forms are extremely rare and should be avoided.

#### Categories Pertaining to Non-finite Verb Forms

Non-finite verb forms are marked for the following categories:

+ **Infinitives** are not marked for any category;
+ **Gerunds** are marked for case;
+ **Participles** express tense-aspect and voice, and, like adjectives, are also marked
for the categories of case (passive participles are also marked for number, @@);
+ **Verbal adjectives** are only marked for the categories of case, number and voice.

**Voice**: all Quenya participle forms also express voice, treated in detail in @@. A basic two way distinction between different kinds of forms may be made:

+ **active** forms;
+ and **passive** forms.

### Morphological Building Blocks: Stems, Endings, and Other Markings

#### Verb Stems and Tense-Aspect Stems

All forms of a certain verb share a **verb stem**, which identifies the forms as deriving from that particular verb: for example, in any form of the verb `talta` (e.g. `atalantiemma`, `taltuvante`, `talanter`), the verb stem `talat-` identifies the form as belonging to that particular verb (and thus expressing in some way the meaning *fall*).

Many Quenya verb stems occur in different variants due to ablaut vowel gradation (@@): for example, the verb stem of the verb `ortä` *rise* occurs as either `ort-` (zero grade), `orot-` (short grade) or `ór-` (lengthened grade). Different tense-aspect stems of such verbs differ in the vowel-grade they show.

For verbs which have variant verb stems, all variants are given below, where required.

Through the addition of endings, augments and ablaut, a **tense-aspect stem** is formed. The tense-aspect stem identifies the form as having a particular combination of tense-aspect.

Six different kinds of tense-aspect stems maybe distinguished; these fall into the three overarching systems described above (@@):

+ aorist tense-aspect: aorist stems, past stems, future stems;
+ present tense-aspect: present stems, imperfect stems;
+ perfect tense-aspect: perfect stems.

The mechanisms involved in forming tense-aspect stems from verb stems are detailed in the individual chapters on the present (@@), aorist (@@), and perfect (@@) stems.

!!! attention "To-Do"
	Verbs lacking certain tense-aspect stems altogether are called **defective verbs**. Are there examples of defective verbs in Quenya?
	
	+ PE22/117: verbs like `lir-` are defective;
	+ -ea verbs from -ng- are defective and don't have present tense stem.
	
#### Thematic Vowels

Some elements appear between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect stem ending:

+ Many Quenya verb forms include a thematic vowel (or: 'theme vowel') `a` standing between the stem and the ending, e.g. <code>ort<b>a</b>uva</code>, <code>hent<b>a</b>nie</code>; for details, @@ below.

#### Endings

Every verb form also has an **ending**, which provides the information required to identify the form as either finite or non-finite, and sometimes its voice, tense, aspect or mood. These endings are called **primary**.

!!! note
	Most often such an ending is referred to as a **suffix**, but here this term is reserved for a derivative block of a new lexeme. By this defnition, the derivational morphology of verbal adjectives, participles and gerunds like `-itë` is a *suffix*, but preterite `-ne` is a *primary ending*. However, for simplicity (particularly due to cases like future participle, where derivational suffix follows its primary ending), they are all discussed under the title of verbal eindings.
	
Some verbal forms can express additional information in their **secondary ending**: 

+ For finite verbs, the 'personal ending' expresses person and number;
+ For infinitive, the 'possessive ending' also expresses person and number;
+ The endings of gerund, participles and verbal adjectives might express case and number.

The endings are treated more fully below, @@.

#### Augments and Prepositional Prefixes

Finally, some elements precede the stem:

+ perfect stems might include an augment, which takes the form of a **root vowel**[^app1] directly preceding the stem (e.g. `e-cénie`), or, if the verb stem begins with a vowel, either that vowel is lengthened (e.g. `úlie`) or the syllable is duplicated (`orórie`). For details, @@.
+ Many compound verbs begin with a prepositional prefix, an original preposition integrated into the verb form, e.g. `ettulë`, `aucirë` (@@). These prefixes are always the first element of a form, preceding even augments and reduplications (@@).

A final consonant of such prefixes often assimilates to the following sound: e.g. `eccezë` but `etecézie` (@@).

!!! tip "Assumption"
	If the prefix ends in a vowel, this vowel usually drops out before another vowel (elision, @@).

!!! note
	For reduplications, @@.

[^app1]: also known as `ómataima`.

## Verbal Stems

Quenya verbal stems split into seven major groups or **conjugations**:

1. **basic verbs**: most numerous group of bare primitive <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal</span> shape: `cen-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;ken</span>) *see*, `tul-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tul</span>) *come*, `mat-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;mat</span>) *eat*;
2. **long verbs**: triconsonantal verbs of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;talat</span> shape: `talat-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;talat</span>) *fall*, `carap-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;karap</span>) *speak*, `sulup-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;sulup</span>) *drink*;
3. **vocalic-progressive** or **a-verbs**: verbs with an inherently continuative sense of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ā</span> shape: `gala-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;gal-ā</span>) *grow*, `fara-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;spar-ā</span>) *hunt*, `hora-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;skor-ā</span>) *wait*;
4. **vocalic-inceptive** or **u-verbs**: verbs often with an inherently inchoactive sense of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ū</span> shape (with or without a consonantal element): `haru-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;khad-ū</span>) *sit down*, `liru-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;lir-ū</span>) *sing*, `cainu-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kaj-nū</span>) *lie down*;
5. **formative verbs**: verbs that add an additional consonant to the stem, usually of inchoactive or anticausative meaning, of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-t</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-j</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-s</span> shape: `cait-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kaj-t</span>) *lie*, `siry-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;sir-j</span>) *flow*, `cals-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kal-s</span>) *shine*;
6. **causative verbs**: verbs with an inherently causative meaning that add an additional syllable to the stem of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ta</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ja</span> shape: `caita-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;caj-ta</span>) *lay*, `tulta-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tul-ta</span>) *send*, `tulya-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tul-ja</span>) *lead*;
7. **derivative verbs**: verbs formed from nouns or adjectives, with or without addition of derivative elements: `tengua-` *read* (from `tengua` *letter*), `remba-` *trap* (from `rembe` *net*), `telconta-` *stride* (from `telco` *leg*).

Together conjugations 2-7 are known as **secondary verbs**.

## Thematic and Athematic Conjugations

Quenya verb forms are either thematic or athematic. Thematic forms include a thematic vowel `a` between the verb-stem and the non-finite or tense-aspect ending. Athematic forms do not include a thematic vowel: thus in athematic forms tense-aspect ending is attached immediately to the stem:

+ **Thematic conjugations**: all causative tense forms, all but future tense of derivative verbs, aorist and preterite tense forms of a-verbs, aorist tense form of long and formative verbs;
+ **Athematic conjugations**: all basic and u-verbs tense forms, all but aorist tense forms of long and formative verbs, all but pretertire and future tense forms of a-verbs, future tense forms of derivative verbs.

Some examples with the a-verb (3rd conjugation) `fara` *hunt*:

+ `faran`: 1 sg. aor. thematic: thematic vowel `a` stands between the ending `-n` and the aorist-stem;
+ `fáran`: 1 sg. pres. athematic: the tense-aspect ending `a` is a part of the present-stem;
+ `faranen`: 1 sg. pret. thematic: thematic vowel `a` stands between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect ending `-ne`;
+ `faruvan`: 1 sg. fut. athematic: the tense-aspect ending `-uva` is attached to the verb-stem directly;
+ `faráve`: ger. thematic: thematic vowel `a` is inserted before the gerundial ending;
+ `farite`: inf. athematic: the infinitive ending `-ita` is attached directly to the verb-stem.

!!! tip "Assumption"
	No infinitive form but of basic verbs is attested. 

## Endings

### Endings of Finite Forms

The endings of finite verb forms are divided into **primary**, which mark tense-aspect, and **secondary** or 'personal' which mark person and number of its subject.

#### Primary Endings

##### Tense-Aspect Endings

|	aorist	|	present	|	preterite	|	perfect	|	future	|
|	---	|	---	|	---	|	---	|	---	|
|	-(ë)	|	-(y)a	|	-(n)e	|	-(n)ie	|	-uva	|

More details in @@.

##### Imperative Ending

!!! attention "To-Do"

#### Personal Endings

The (a)personal endings of finite verb forms are the same for all stems:

+ Apersonal endings mark only **number**, and they are used when the subject of the verb is **explicit**;
+ Personal endings mark **number and person** when the subject is left **implicit**;
+ In singular personal endings can be either short or long depending on euphonic environment.

### Endings of Non-finite Forms

#### Primary Endings

|	infinitive	|	gerund	|	active participle	|	passive participle	|
|	---	|	---	|	---	|	---	|
|	-ita	|	-ie, -ve	|	-(i)la	|	-(i)na	|

!!! note
	Participles express tense and therefore employ primary endings of **both finite and non-finite forms**: `car-uva-ila` *that will be doing*. They are not marked for aspect, however, so **perfect** ending is used for **past tense**, **aorist** ending for **present tense**.

More details in @@.

#### Possessive Endings

Even though non-finite forms don't use secondary 'personal' endings to denote subject like finite forms do, they nonetheless can express it with substantive **'possessive' endings** (&rarr;@@): `caritalya·s` *your doing it*. For details, @@.

#### Nominal Endings

Gerund and participles function as nouns and therefore can receive a **case ending**. Gerund declines as a second-declension noun (&rarr;[4.@@](nou.md#sdn)), and participles as a first-declension noun (&rarr;[4.@@](nou.md#fdna)).

	The write-up is a bit lazy. Return to this section later.

## Augments and Reduplications

### Formation of the Augment

Perfect-stem forms (though, not only) normally include an augment, which immediately precedes the stem. The form of the augment is determined by the initial sound of the (tense-aspect) stem.

##### With Stems Beginning with a Consonant

If the stem begins with a consonant, the augment takes the form of a **root vowel**:

|	verbal stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	mat-		| 	a-mátie			|
|	tul-		| 	u-túlie			|
|	h·or-		|	o-hórie			|

With stems beginning with strong `n`, `m`, `ng`[^aar1] (&rarr;@@), that strong consonant is restored:

|	verbal stem	|	aorist stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---			|	---				|
|	ndac-		| 	nacë	|	a-ndácie			|
|	mbar-		| 	marë	|	a-mbárie			|
|	ngor-		|	ngorë	|	o-ngórie			|

!!! important "Late Tarquesta"
	Eventually those forms were brought into line with aorist stems: `nacë` > `anácie`, `marë` > `amárie`. As `ng-` became `n-`, it appeared as such: `norë` > `onórie`.

[^aar1]: The difference is more obvious in transcription schemas that use `ñ-` for initial *ngoldo*: `ñorë` > `ongórie`.

##### With Stems Beginning with a Vowel or Diphthong

If the stem begins with a vowel, the augment usually gets absorbed into it with the lengthening (and in lengthened-grade ablaut it disappears):

|	verbal stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	ap-			| 	a-ápie > ápie	|
|	ef-			| 	e-éfie > éfie	|
|	ul-			|	u-úlie > úlie	|

!!!note
	A silent `g-` is purely an orthographic convenience. Stems with it behave like stems beginning with vowels: verbal stem `gal-`, perfect stem `ga-álie` > `gálie`.
	
It is also common for some verbs (and more generally in verse) to use reduplication instead (see below, @@):

### Formation of Reduplications

Frequentative and sometimes perfect stems are formed by the addition of a reduplication to the verb stem. Reduplications consist of a consonant + root vowel, and may substitute an augment with stems starting with a vowel.

##### Three Types of Reduplication

With verb stems beginning

+ with a single consonant, `ty-` or `qu-`,
+ strong nasals (`nd-`, `mb-`, `ng-`), or other palatilized consonants (`ny-`, `ly-`[^for1], `j-`):

**reduplication = initial consonant + root vowel**:

|	verbal stem	|	frequentative stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	sil-		| 	sisilla			|
|	tyal-		| 	tyatyalla		|
|	ndac-		|	nandacca		|
|	nyar-		|	nanyarra		|
|	jam-		|	hajamma			|

With verb stems beginning

+ with a combination of stop + `s` (`cs-`, `ps-`, `ts-`),
+ voiceless liquid (`hl-`, `hr-`):

**reduplication = second consonant + root vowel**:

|	verbal stem	|	frequentative stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	psar-		| 	sapsarra		|
|	csar-		|	sacsarra		|
|	hlas-		| 	lahlassa		|
|	hris-		|	rihrissa		|

With verb stems beginning

+ with a vowel:

**reduplication = root vowel + final consonant**:

|	verbal stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	is-t-		| 	is-ísie			|
|	ol-			| 	ol-ólie			|
|	or-y-		|	or-órie			|

##### Further Particulars

Verbal roots of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tā</span> shape frequently show **inversion**. When this happens, augment and reduplication follow regular 'consonant-first' form:

|	verbal stem	|	stem with augment	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	au-t- < wā-t| 	a-wá-nie		|
|	is-t- < sī-t| 	i-si-nte		|
|	or-y- < rō-j|	o-ro-nte		| 

### The Relative Position of Augments, Reduplications and Prefixes

##### Basic Rules

!!! important "Rules"
	In compound verbs that include a prepositional prefix, any augment or reduplication comes after the prefix: `entul-` > `en-u-túlie`.

[^for1]: If `gy-` > `ly-`, something to sort later.
