title: Trimoraic diphthong

import Aside from '../../../../components/newAside.astro';

<Aside type="quote" title="RGEO/63">Of the "long diphthongs" _ae, oe, au, ui_, only _ae_ and _ui_ appear. â€¦ The first vowel (_a_ and _u_) was in both somewhat prolonged. These diphthongs were thus of a length more or less equal to the time occupied by two syllables, and are therefore occasionally employed metrically where the normal metre requires two.</Aside>

Even though in this instance Tolkien discusses Sindarin, the analysis of his recordings, as well as rhythmic lengthening triggred in two-syllable words containing _ui_, indicate it is likely relevant for Quenya as well.
