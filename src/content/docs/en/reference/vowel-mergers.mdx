<Aside type="quote" title="AppE (I)">long é and ó were, when correctly pronounced, as by the Eldar, tenser and 'closer' than the short vowels.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/106">
+ CE open **ę̄** and close **ē** became merged in *ē*.
+ CE open **ǭ** and close **ō** became merged in *ō*.
+ These sounds Q *ē, ō* were and remained of middle quality, neither very tense and close nor very slack and open.
