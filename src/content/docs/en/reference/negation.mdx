<Aside type="quote" title="PE23/99">When *no, not*, etc. ocurred in the same sentence as *some, any*, the negative was normally combined with the pronominal notion, or derivative adverb: as "nobody, none, nowhere, never," and *not* "not &mdash; anybody, ever," etc. The form *imma* could, however, be added (indeclinable) with the force of "ever, what(so)ever, at all: *ni-kenne allane imma* "I saw nobody at all."</Aside>
