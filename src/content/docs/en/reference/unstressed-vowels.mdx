<Aside type="quote" title="Handwritten note to RGEO">The vowels may be pronounced as in Italian: ē and ō (long) having the 'close' values as in _nero_, _nome_; ĕ and ŏ short, when stressed have the open values as the first syllables of _netto_, _notte_; when unstressed the 'close' values as in the final syllables.</Aside>

In this [handwritten note](https://tolkienlistsearch.herokuapp.com/message/5e9c3627f2d34d9c5125f1f9) Tolkien describes both stressed long vowels and unstressed short vowels as 'close' in Italian:

> Although Italian contrasts close-mid (/e, o/) and open-mid (/ɛ, ɔ/) vowels in stressed syllables, the distinction is neutralised in unstressed position in which only the close-mid vowels occur. The height of such vowels in unstressed position is context-sensitive; they are somewhat lowered (\[e̞, o̞\]) in the vicinity of more open vowels.

That does coincide with his own pronunciation in the recordings, but clearly contradicts his description of [ɛ — e and ɔ — o mergers](./vowel-mergers). Here we follow this note saying that unstressed short vowels had the same quality as long ones, but keep their mid-quality as stated in other materials.

<Aside type="flame" title="Controversial">
Is OP2 note sufficient for such amalgamation? Perhaps **may** is indication that Italian is also meant to be an approximation, and mid-quality is correct.
