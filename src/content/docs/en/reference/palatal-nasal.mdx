Two sources provide mismatching descriptions on whether \<ny\> represents a dental /nj/ sequence or a palatal /ɲj/.

<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/66 (8)">*n* in **ny** is palatal *n* but followed (cf. *ty*) by a *y*-offglide, more marked medially (where *ny* counts as a group), less so initially.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/74 (B.1.i)">*ny* (with a sound as in English *new*)</Aside>

English *new* is transcribed /nju:/, even though in some dialects \[ɲ\] can surface. Tolkien's own pronunciation realized /nj/ as \[ɲj\].
