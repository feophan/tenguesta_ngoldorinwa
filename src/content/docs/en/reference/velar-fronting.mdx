<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE (I)">
+ C has always the value of *k* even before *e* and *i*: *celeb* ‘silver’ should be pronounced as *keleb*
+ G has only the sound of *g* in *give, get*
</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/71 (3.iii)">It was not markedly fronted by adjacent front vowels *e, i*, at least no more than the corresponding stop *k* (or *ck* in English *thick*).</Aside>

For fronting of /k/ in *thick* consider:

>Compare English /k/ in "peak" /pik/ and "keep" /kip/ \[…\] You should find that /k/ undergoes greater influence (alteration of place of articulation) from the following vowel than from a preceding vowel (&rarr;[Multiple Articulation and Coarticulation](http://www.phon.ox.ac.uk/jcoleman/MULTART_unicode.html)).
