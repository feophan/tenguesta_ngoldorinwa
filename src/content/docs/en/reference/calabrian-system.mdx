<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Qenya Phonology</span> provides a few notes on pronunciation: 

<Aside type="quote" title="PE12/8-9">
+ **ĭ**, as in English *pit*, is open but **ī** is close …
+ **ĕ** was open and **ē** somewhat closer …
+ **ā** is slightly farther back (like *a* in English *part*) …
+ **ŏ** is open, **ō** medium close …
+ **ŭ** open, but not so open as in English *put*, being rounder. **ū** close round.
</Aside>

The continued existence of such difference is hinted by this note in TQ2:

<Aside type="quote" title="PE18/83">The situation in CQ is not known, but certainly in Eldarin the long vowels *ī, ē, ō, ū* tended to be tenser and narrower than the short vowels *ĭ, ĕ, ŏ, ŭ*.</Aside>

which is taken here to ultimately support the 'Calabrian' system as the pronunciation system of choice.
