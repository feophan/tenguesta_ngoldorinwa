<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE">HW is a voiceless *w*, as in English *white* (in northern pronunciation).</Aside>

## Rule 2

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/57">The secondary accents were placed (subject to other considerations) on **alternate** syllables in either direction from the main stress. The secondaries that *preceded* the main stress (e.g. in oxytone or paroxytone words) were the strongest.</Aside>

## Rule 4

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/65 ft.">Strong secondary accent fell on **initial** or long syllable separated by one or more shorts from stress.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/60">The secondary accent falling on the initial syllable, or any non-initial long syllable, that was separated (by an intervening stressless long or one or more stressless short) from the main was strong.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="RGEO/61">In the very frequent cases of words ending in two short syllables, \[...\] they received a light stress that could be used metrically.</Aside>

## Exception 1

<Aside type="quote" title="EVS2: PE22/139">¶ In Q. when this was added with suppression of aorist-present vowel the expression was very imperious or urgent: tulā́, come at once! oryā́, get up.</Aside>

In this passage in what Tolkien explicitly calls Quenya, both length and final stress are denoted. 

## Exception 2

<Aside type="quote" title="PE12/26-27">In quadrisyllables and more the stress (chief) can never go farther back than three syllables, except in one case, that of quadrisyllables where the two internal syllables *consist of 2 short vowels in hiatus*. This is also the only case where a short final vowel bears a strong secondary stress. *Areanor* is accented **Áreanòr**, but *Areanóre* is accented **Àreanóre**.</Aside>

This is contradicted by an early draft on Eldarin accent:

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/60 ft. 152">But before the development of the Parmaquesta the main stress became fixed. It then fell on the **penultimate** syllable, when that was *long*; where it was *short*, the main stress fell on the **ante**-**penult**. It never fell further back, nor did it fall on final syllables other than monosyllabic words.</Aside>

But stating that it *never* falls outside of the main rule would mean a rejection of Exception 1, of which we know the imperative must be stressed finally.

## Exception 3

<Aside type="quote" title="PE21/41">
+ **Orome**, *Óromèa*, *Óromèo*
+ **Tampio**, *Támpiòa*
</Aside>

## Exception 4

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/64 (ft. 166)">In the earlier stages of **Quenya** (Lindarin) it appears to have been normally retracted to the initial syllable, though certain prefixes such as *al*, *wa* > *o*, etc. were often not stressed.</Aside>

## Exception 5

<Aside type="quote" title="HoME-XI/407">*roquen* is < \**roko-kwen* with Quenya syncope, \**roko* being an older simpler form of the stem, found in some compounds and compound names, though the normal form of the independent word 'horse' had the fortified form *rokko*. These compounds being old were accented as unitary words and the main stress came on the syllable preceding -*quen* \[…\]</Aside>

## Exception 6

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/58">
But in normal long words, especially those made with derivative suffixes etc., the secondary accent was attracted by a long syllable (not adjacent to stress), and *never* fell on a *short* final syllable. A **strong secondary** accent was borne by a *long* syllable separated from the main (a) by *one* syllable, long or short: types *màndălḗ*, *kártastā̀*; or (b) by two syllables: type *kárpalimā̀*. A **weak secondary** was borne by the furthest of a series of two or three short syllables that *preceded* the *main*, types *àlakánda*, *kằlŭmălánda*, *kằlŭmălṓ*.

Note that a long syllable adjacent to the stress did not attract the secondary, so *èrĕmăloitḗ*.
</Aside>

Note that this paragraph talks about CE stress before the Quenya stress shift. However, we assume that the logic of secondary stress placement stays the same:

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/60">The **secondary stresses** were usually reorganized and governed by the main stress; but on same principles as those described above for the archaic period &mdash; except that a secondary accent (often\[?\] with low tone) could stand on an initial syllable immediately before a long main stress, as in *cṑmallo* above.</Aside>

## Rule 3 & Exception 7

<Aside type="quote" title="RGEO/60-61">The initial syllable usually retained some degree of stress. In long words, especially recognized compounds, it was, though lower in tone, often equal in force to the main stress: as in *óromárdi*, *fálmalínnar*, etc. It was weaker when immediately preceding the main stress, as in *Àndū́ne*, *ṑmáryo*, *Tìntálle*, *Rṑméllo*; and in such cases, if it was short it became unstressed, as in *avā́niër*.</Aside>
