<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/65 (3)">**s** is not strictly homorganic with the other dentals, but is now whatever its origins (these are various) the normal *s*, a voiceless 'blade' consonant, with the blade of the tongue in contact (and so possessing an *i*-timbre), but with the point touching the lower teeth. It has no tendency, even before \[i\] to palatalization to \[š\] or \[ç\].</Aside>
