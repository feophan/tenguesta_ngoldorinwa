<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/65 (2-9)">
Both *l* and *r* are partially **unvoiced** before *p, t, k, ty, q, s*.

After voiceless stops, in *q* (= *kw*), *tw, ty, py* they \{*y, w*\} are partly unvoiced (but not spirantal).

\{*ty*\} is followed by an appreciable partly unvoiced *y*-offglide.

**q** (**kw**) consists of a lip-rounded *kÌŠ* followed by a partly unvoiced *w*-offglide

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/99 (v.a)">*r, l* were partly unvoiced before the voiceless stops, *s*, and the aspirates, in that order</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/100 (b)">**y**, **w** remained as a rule unchanged, except for a marked unvoicing after *p, t, k*; *s*; and the aspirates.</Aside>
