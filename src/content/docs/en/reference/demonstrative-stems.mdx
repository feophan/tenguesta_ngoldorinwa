import Aside from '../../../../components/newAside.astro';

In PE23 Tolkien lists a number of demonstrative stems:

|              | DRC             | EP2a | EP2b |  EP2 |
|------        |--------         |--|--| ----- |
| *ya*         | remote          | back unseen | back unseen | back unseen, relative |
| *sa*         | referred        | weak 'not here' | weak 'not here' | not here |
| *ta*         | not here        | strong 'not here' | strong 'not here' | remote seen |
| *kha*        | &mdash;         | &mdash; | obviative | obviative |
| *i*          | relative        | = *ya* | = *ya* | = *ya* |
| *en*         | remote          | | remote | remote |
| *si*         | prox. 1p. excl. | prox. 1p. excl. | prox. 1p. excl. | prox. 1p. excl. |
| *khi*        | prox. 1p. incl. | prox. 1p. incl. | &mdash; | &mdash; |
| *ti*         | prox. 2p.       | prox. 2p. | prox. 1p. incl. | prox. 1p. incl. |
| *ki*         | prox. 2p.       | &mdash; | prox. 2p. | prox. 2p. |

- where the **weak** 'not here' was explained as:

<Aside type="quote" title="EP2a">had little deictic reference and was the least physical: it could refer to any point not *here* to the speaker</Aside>
<Aside type="quote" title="EP2b">had reference to any point not 'here'to the speaker, but was unemphatic (and never, for instance, accompanied by pointing)</Aside>
<Aside type="quote" title="EP2">was unemphatic, and never accompanied by pointing, and referred to any point other than the speaker's 'here'</Aside>

- the **strong** 'not here' was explained as:

<Aside type="quote" title="EP2a">was more physical and in correlatives referred to a point or thing near and present not merely in mind</Aside>
<Aside type="quote" title="EP2b">was more emphatic, and referred to a point not 'here' (to the speaker), but near and present</Aside>
<Aside type="quote" title="EP2">point within the speaker's view, not 'here', but near and present</Aside>

EP2 had 2p pronoun base *ke*. However, PE 17/17 and VT 49/50-52 changed it to *ki*, making demonstrative *ki* likely unsuitable. And indeed, *khi* reappears again in late notes (VT49/34, notes are referred to in VT49/11 as DN).
