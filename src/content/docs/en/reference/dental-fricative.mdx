<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/71 (3.ii)">**th** became the interdental spirant \[þ\], more or less identical with the sound of *th* in English *thin*.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE">TH represents the voiceless *th* of English in *thin cloth*.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="VT41/7-8">This in Quenya was earlier, as it remained in Vanyarin, a *dental* spirant (made with the tongue-tip behind the back of the upper front teeth, which makes the passage to *s* easier). \[…\] Why the Ñoldor did not then proceed to adopt the interdental *þ* and so clarify the distinction between *þ* and *s* remains uncertain.</Aside>
