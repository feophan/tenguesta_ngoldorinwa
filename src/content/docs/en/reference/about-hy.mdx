<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE">HY has the same relation to *y* as HW to *w*, and represents a sound like that often heard in English *hew, huge*; *h* in Quenya *eht, iht* had the same sound.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/75 (ii)">
**khy** became first \[χy\] with voiceless *y* and marked fronting of the \[χ\]. The result already in PQ was initially and medially a strong voiceless *y* \[ꜧ\], here transcribed *hy*, similar to, but more frictional than the initial sound in English *huge*.

In Vanyarin this sound became \[š\] as English *sh*, and those among the Noldor who adopted the V. rhotacism (see above) also imitated this feature of Vanyarin. It did not, however, become a feature of Noldorin TQ.

<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/65 (5)">**hy** is an audibly spirantal voiceless *y*, that is approximately \[ç\] as *ch* in German *ich*.</Aside>
