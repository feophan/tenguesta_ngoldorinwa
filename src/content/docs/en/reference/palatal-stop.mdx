<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/66 (6)">*t* in **ty** is the 'front explosive' \[c\], as e.g. Hungarian *ty*; but it is followed by an appreciable partly unvoiced *y*-offglide. This is more marked medially (where *ty* counts as a group); less so initially.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE (I)">TY represents a sound probably similar to the *t* in English *tune*. It was derived mainly from *c* or *t+y*. The sound of English *ch*, which was frequent in Westron, was usually substituted for it by speakers of that language.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/75">*ty* in Vanyarin acquired the sound \[tʃ\], that of *ch* in English *church*. This *ch* was also imitated by some of the Noldor but did not become a feature of Exilic TQ; though it reappeared in Numenórean use of Quenya.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE13/63">In sound it is now a very forward palatal stop foll\[owed\] by a distinct *y* off-glide; in some dialects it is practically E\[nglish\] *ch* with or without a clear *y* off-glide.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE14/41">**ty**: is a very fronted 'k' or palatalised 't' followed by a fairly distinct 'y'-glide</Aside>
