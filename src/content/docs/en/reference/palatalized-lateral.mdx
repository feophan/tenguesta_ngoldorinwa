<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/65 (2)">**l** is normal between vowels and initially; but is slightly palatalized before *y*, and between *i* and a following consonant.</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE">It was, however, to some degree 'palatalized' between *e, i* and a consonant, or finally after *e, i*.</Aside>
