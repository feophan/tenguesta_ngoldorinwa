<Aside type="quote" title="LotR AppE">HW is a voiceless *w*, as in English *white* (in northern pronunciation).</Aside>

<Aside type="quote" title="PE19/75 (2.ii)">
**khw** became first \[χw\] with unvoiced *w*. Parallel to the development of *khy* this became in PQ a spirantal voiceless *w* \[ƕ\]. It was more tense with closer lip-aperture and more friction than the voiceless *wh* of English. This combination was in CE rare medially, but not uncommon initially. It is here transcribed *hw*.

In later Vanyarin pronunciation *hw* became *f*, but remained distinct from *f* in Noldorin and in the Exilic TQ.

<Aside type="quote" title="PE22/65 (5)">**hw** is similarly and audibly spirantal voiceless *w*, that is \[ƕ\] as in English *wh* in *white* (in certain varieties of pronunciation).</Aside>
