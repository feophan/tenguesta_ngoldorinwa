## Introduction: Sentence Types and Communicative Functions

In principle, utterances belong to one of three different **sentence types**:

- **declarative**: e.g.

	1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="tulil márië nin"/> \[PE22/158\] *you come happily for me.*

+ **interrogative**: e.g.

	1. <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="mana i coimas Eldaron?"/> \[PM/395\] *What is the ‘coimas’ of the Eldar?*

+ **imperative**: e.g.

	1. <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="áva carë"/> \[WJ/371\] *Don’t do it!*

Sentence type is determined principally by the mood particle accompanying the main verb (&rarr;@@) and by the intonation of the utterance.

:::note[Note 1]
It is sometimes not straightforward to determine the sentence type of an individual utterance: our knowledge about the intonation of Quenya utterances is limited (&rarr;@@).
:::

:::note[Note 2]
‘Desideratives’ (wishes) and ‘exclamatives’ (exclamations) are sometimes distinguished as additional, separate sentence types. For wishes and exclamations, &rarr;@@ and @@.
:::

Although there is a correlation between the sentence type of an utterance and the **communicative functions** that may be performed by that utterance (such functions include ‘request’, ‘wish’, ‘command’, ‘assertion’, ‘question’), one and the same linguistic form may (in different contexts) serve various communicative functions. For instance, each of the following examples is in the interrogative form, but the communicative functions they perform are different:

<Warning type="req">Examples required</Warning>

Conversely, different linguistic forms may serve similar communicative functions. For instance, each of the following examples serves as a request or command to someone to speak (for the different nuances of each of these constructions, &rarr;@@):

<Warning type="req">Examples required</Warning>

:::note[Note 3]
The technical term for the communicative function of an utterance (as distinct from sentence type) is ‘illocution’or ‘illocutionary force’.
:::

:::note[Note 4]
For examples of the imperative mood used to express non-directive communicative functions, @@.

## Questions

### Introduction: Basic Terminology

There are two main types of questions:

+ Questions that are answered by yes or no: ‘**yes/no-questions**’ &ndash; cf. *Are whales fish?* A subset of this type consists of questions that give two (or more) alternatives to choose from: ‘**alternative questions**’ or ‘double questions’ &ndash; cf. *Are whales fish or mammals?*
+ Questions that are answered by specifying one or more persons, things, places, etc. (or ‘no one’, ‘nothing’, etc.). Such questions are commonly known as ‘wh-questions’ (as they are, in English, usually introduced by a ‘wh-word’, such as *who?, when?, why?* etc.), or as ‘**specifying questions**’: cf. *What kind of animal are whales?*

For indirect/dependent questions, i.e. the representation of questions in indirect speech/thought (cf. Engl. *He asked what kind of animal whales are*), &rarr;@@.

### Yes/No-Questions and Alternative Questions

Questions may be introduced by various particles. Yes/no-questions introduced by <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ma"/> (@@) are **neutral**: they do not explicitly expect or desire a particular answer:

<Warning type="req">Examples required</Warning>

Frequently, no particle at all is used to introduce a neutral yes/no-question:

<Warning type="req">Examples required</Warning>

By using a question introduced with <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="naite"/> (&rarr;@@), a speaker signals that he **expects** or **desires the answerto be‘yes’** (cf. in English the similar use of the negative, of a negative ‘tag question’, or *surely*):

<Warning type="req">Examples required</Warning>
