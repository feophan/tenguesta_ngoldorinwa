## Basic Notions and Terminology

### Tense

**Tense** concerns the location of an action in time relative to some other moment. A distinction can be made between absolute tense and relative tense:

+ **Absolute tense** concerns the location of an action in the past, present or future, relative to the moment of speaking:

	The Noldor **burned** Alqualonde. *past*
	The Noldor **are burning** Alqualonde. *present*
	The Noldor **will burn** Alqualonde. *future*

+ **Relative tense** concerns the location of an action in time **relative to another temporal reference point given in the context**, either prior to that reference point (**anteriority**), at the same time as that reference point (**simultaneity**), or after it (**posteriority**):

	We arrived when the Noldor **had burned** Alqualonde. *anterior* to a moment in the past
	We arrived when the Noldor **were burning** Alqualonde. *simultaneous* with a moment in the past
	By the time we arrive, the Noldor **will have burned** Alqualonde. *anterior* to a moment in the future
	The Noldor said that they **would burn** Alqualonde. *posterior* to a moment in the past

The **indicatives** of the Quenya verb, when used in main clauses, express absolute tense:

+ the **present indicative** and **perfect indicative** refer to the **present** (i.e. the moment of speaking);
+ the **imperfect** and **preterite** refer to the **past**;
+ the **future indicative** refers to the **future**:

EXAMPLES

Outside main clauses, indicatives frequently receive a relative-tense interpretation in addition to, or instead of, an absolute-tense interpretation (@@ below).

{/*
**Moods other than the indicative** (i.e. the subjunctive, optative and imperative) and **non-finite forms of the verb** (infinitives, participles and verbal adjectives), **do not inherently express tense**, but only aspect. Their aspectual value, however, may lead to a relative-tense interpretation (@@ below).

### Aspect

#### Grammatical Aspect

**Grammatical aspect** (usually simply called 'aspect') concerns the way in which an action is presented or regarded, particularly with respect to its internal composition: it can be presented as a single and **complete whole** (an action in its entirety), without any separate component parts of the action being envisaged, or as **incomplete** (an action that is ongoing or repeated, that can conceivably be interrupted), with several component parts being envisaged. Note that what matters is not whether an action has component parts, but whether the speaker is interested in presenting these component parts as relevant.

The tense-aspect **stems** of the Quenya verb express three different aspectual values:

+ The **present stem** presents an action as **incomplete**, focusing on one or more of its intermediate stages, but leaving its boundaries (beginning and end) out of focus. It thus normally signifies that an action is **ongoing** or **repeated**. This is called **continuous aspect**.

+ The **aorist stem** has a temporal value but no aspectual one: they are aspectually **neutral**, and make no formal distinction between an imperfective (incomplete) or perfective (complete) presentation of actions. This is called **simple aspect**.

+ The **perfect stem** presents an action as a **state** resulting from a preceding completed action, or it signifies that the **effects** of the completed action are somehow still **relevant**.

As the above definitions indicate, the selection of a specific stem (grammatical aspect) depends not so much on any objective properties of the action itself (for such objective properties, &rarr;@@), but on a speaker's (subjective) needs and choices in presenting an action in a certain way. What matters most is whether a speaker is interested in drawing attention to any component parts (or conversely, the boundaries) of an action.

#### Lexical Aspect

**Lexical aspect** refers to the temporal structure of a specific action **inherent** in the verb's meaning: does it have duration, and is it directed towards an end-point? As opposed to grammatical aspect, lexical aspect thus has to do with the **objective** properties of an action, rather than with subjective ways of presenting that action.

## Tense and Aspect Combined: The Indicative in Main Clauses

### Basic Values of the Indicative; Narrative and Non-Narrative Text

#### The Ten Indicatives of Quenya: Basic Values

Sections @@-@@ give an overview of the use of **indicatives in main clauses** (for indicatives in subordinate clauses, &rarr;@@ and chapters @@-@@). The interpretation of indicatives depends in the first place on the **interaction between tense and grammatical aspect**. Combining the aspectual and temporal values described above, the Quenya indicative expresses the following tense/aspect-distinctions (using the verb <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="carë"/> *make* as an example):

+ The **present simple** (or **present aorist**) expresses an action, located at the moment of speaking (i.e. in the present), that is presented as **repeated**: <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="carin"/> *I (habitually) make*
+ The **present continuous** (or simply **present**) expresses an action, located at the moment of speaking (i.e. in the present), that is presented as **ongoing**: <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="cáran"/> *I am making*
+ The **past simple** (or **past aorist**) expresses an action, located in the **past**, presented as a complete whole: <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="carne"/> *I made*
+ The **past continuous** (or **imperfect**) expresses an action, located in the **past**, that is presented as **ongoing** or **repeated**: <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="cárane"/> *I was making / I (habitually) made*
+ The **future** expresses an action (either as a single occurrence or as ongoing/repeated), located in the **future**: <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="caruva"/> *I will make / I will be making*
+ The **perfect** expresses a **state**, located at the **present**, that is the result of a completed action; or it expresses that the effects of the completed action are still in some way relevant at the present: <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="acárien"/> *I have made* (< and it exists)

The following table provides an overview of the seven indicatives:

	</tr>
</table>

#### Narrative and Non-Narrative Text

The **type of text** in which an indicative (in a main clause) is used is often significant in interpretation. A (rough) distinction may be drawn here between **narrative** and **non-narrative** text:

+ **Narrative text** is storytelling: it relates (usually in chronological order) a sequence of actions that took place in the (real or fictive) past, and how they are related to each other. It normally contains a mix of imperfects/pluperfects and past aorist indicatives together with historical aorists. Examples: historical accounts and tales.
+ **Non-narrative text** is everything else. Main verbs will normally be indicatives of the aorist, present, past, perfect and future, with other moods used apart from the indicative. Examples: most dialogues, discussions, arguments, general descriptions of habits and customs.

The use of indicatives in narrative is treated in detail in @@.@@-@@, including some phenomena which are peculiar to narrative contexts.

### Present

#### Basic Uses

The present continuous refers to actions that occur at the **moment of speaking**. By virtue of its intraterminal aspect (incomplete), it is used by default to refer to actions which are **ongoing** at the moment of speaking:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="órenya quéta nin"/> \[VT41/13\]. *My heart is saying to me*
2. <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="Sinar Orome i·tauresse faralye"/> \[MQ: PE22/116\]. *Today Orome is hunting in the forest*.

:::tip[Assumption based on Classical Greek and Turkish]
The ongoing action referred to by the present continuous may have begun long before the moment of speaking, and an expression of duration is sometimes added:

<Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Elessar ando cúnia"/> *Elessar has been a king for a long time*

*Observe that Engl. here prefers a present perfect (continuous)*.
:::

The present is also frequently used with **states** which are true at the moment of speaking:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="hísie untúpa Calaciryo míri oiale"/> \[LotR/377\]. *Mist covers the jewels of Calacirya forever*
2. <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="sinan Elessar Aran séra Arcimbelesse"/> \[MQ: PE22/125\]. *At present King Elessar is at Rivendell*
3. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="enyasse Manwe hára"/> \[MQ: PE22/125\]. *There far away dwells Manwe*

:::note
*Observe that Engl. here prefers a present simple*.
:::

:::tip[Assumption based on Turkish]
In this sense the present often competes with the aorist in describing the **observation of habitual actions** and **generalizations based on experience**, particularly if they're temporally bounded:

+ <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="Uqua víria sina nóresse"/> *Nothing changes in this land*
+ <Tengwar tengwar="     " latin="Farandor rémar úmea farnar si loa"/> *Hunters are catching plenty of game this year*
:::

The present can also be used to denote a **bouletic future** with the sense of **immediate urgency**:

1. <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="vá ménanye"/> \[PE22/162\]. *I am* ***not*** *coming (I say)*

{/*
#### Specific Interpretations

With **telic** verbs such as ???, the present stem may refer to an (unsuccessful) attempt, because it indicates that the end-point of the action has so far not been reached. This is called the **conative** interpretation of the present:

### Aorist

The aorist indicative is used very often in narrative texts (for details on its use there, &rarr;@@); however, it also has a few specific uses outside narrative.

For the 'modal' use of the aorist (in counterfactual statements, unrealizable wishes, etc.), &rarr;@@.

#### Basic Uses

The aorist is used to refer to **repeated** or **habitual** actions:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Orome tauresse fara"/> *Orome hunts in forests* \[MQ: PE22/116\]

The aorist is used to refer to **general** or **timeless** truths which are continuously in effect:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="     " latin="imbi Menel Cemenye mene Ráno tie"/> \[VT47/11\]. *Between Heaven and Earth goes the path of the Moon*

The aorist is also used in:

+ proverbs:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="csaráre psare zúle"/> *longing frets the spirit*

+ vivid present as in telling stories or jokes:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="auta i·lóme"/> *the night is passing*
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="laurie lantar lassi"/> *like gold fall the leaves*
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="antanen hatal sena"/> *I cast a spear at him*
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="zindanóriello caita mornie"/> *out of a grey country darkness lies*

+ common expressions:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="mecin"/> *please*

Verbs of **state of mind**, e.g. *know*, *believe*, *think*, *love*, express state that involves no change, and both the present and the aorist effectively carry the same aspectual meaning, could be considered nearly synonymous, and thus, could be interchangeably used to entail certain meanings:

+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="istanye·s"/> *I know it*
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="istyanye·s"/> *I know it*

An aorist form of these verbs is certainly more common, however, particularly with quasi-modal verbs:

1. <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="polin quetë"/> *I can speak* [\[PE17/181\]](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-584272923.html)

:::tip
Where the aorist and the present are interchangeable, the aorist has a connotation of *characterization*, while the present that of *observation*.
:::

#### Specific Interpretations

The aorist indicative of <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="tulë"/> *come* and similar verbs normally refers to the future:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   ⸱" latin="ni qete sa e·tule"/> *I say that he is coming* \[PE22/119\]

Observe that this does not normally hold for forms other than the aorist.

In certain contexts, speakers can refer to a single action *begun and completed* at (approximately) the moment of speaking — the **instantaneous aorist**. A frequent context for this use is that of **performatives**, first-person indicatives which describe the speech act of which they are part (and thus refer to actions that are completed as soon as the utterance is completed):

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="la navin caritalyas mára"/> *I do not advise you to do so* [\[PE22/154\]](https://eldamo.org/content/words/word-2955623237.html)

The instantaneous aorist also occurs, rarely, in 'simultaneous narration', i.e. when a speaker narrates a sequence of actions as they occurin the present. This in fact also occurs when speakers present actions in the past as if they occur in the present — the 'historical aorist'. This use is treated separately in @@.@@ (cf. also the 'aorist for the future', @@.@@).

Quenya morphology allows the aorist, present, and future affixes to be used in combination with additional past suffixes. It is common to omit the second suffix except for the first verb in series [PE22/129-130]:

+ <Tengwar tengwar="  ⸱   ⸱  ⸱    ⸱    " latin="tuldes mardanna, latya fendi, yalë, ú-hlarë hanquenta, cezë i-zambessen..."/> *he came home, opened the doors, called, heard no answer, searched all the rooms...*

For the use of the aorist in conditional and counter-factual clauses, &rarr;@@.

### Perfect

#### Basic Uses

The **perfect indicative** signifies that an action has been **completed in the immediate past** and that the effects of that action are in some way **relevant in the present**. Cross-linguistically focus of its functions lie on the spectrum between this past action and its current effect. In the extreme cases it can become then either a general past tense or a state, abstracted from its actional component.

The following perfect functions are the most common:

+ **resultative perfect** expresses a more or less **permanent state in the present** which exists as the result of a completed action in the past: *Mary has already arrived*
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="yéni avánier ve lintë yuldar"/> *years have passed away like swift draughts* \[RGEO/58\]

+ **experiential perfect**: *I have never been to Paris*
	+ &rarr; **not attested** &rarr; **past aorist**

+ **continuative perfect**: *Mary has lived in London for five years*
	+ &rarr; **not attested** &rarr; **present**

+ **recent past perfect**: *The Orioles have just won*
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="⸱   " latin="ni·utúlie nyariello ve atarella"/> *I have just come from talking with your father \[PE22/119\]

:::tip[Assumption from Greek]
Especially with telic verbs, **active forms** of the perfect are often used to emphasize the **responsibility** of the subject for the state that has resulted from a past action (they are particularly frequent in oratory):

### Past Aorist

The past aorist is used very often in narrative texts (for details on its use there, &rarr;@@.@@-@@); however, it also has a few specific uses outside narrative.

#### Basic Uses

The aorist indicative is used to present the occurrence of an action in the past, without reference to its duration or process, but presenting the action asa single, uninterruptable whole. As such, the aorist is the default tense **in narrative texts** to record **single**, **complete actions**:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="           " latin="sustanë Manwëo súlë ten i indo Sindicollo ar he lastanë ar carnes"/> *the spirit of Manwe blew unto the heart of Thingol and he listened and did it* \[NM/239\]

In **non-narrative text**, the past aorist is typically used to observe or conclude that an action has been completed by the moment of speaking. This is sometimes called the **constative aorist**:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="manen lambë Quendion ahyanë"/> *How did the language of the Elves change?* \[PM/395\]

:::note
Like in Old English, Quenya aorist easily combines with temporal adverbs, including `sí` *now*. In such cases aorist translates to English with *present perfect*. Seemingly intechangeable, such constructions focus on the **action** itself, while perfect --- on the resulting **state**:

+ <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="sí Varda ortanë máryat Oiolossëo"/> *for now Varda has lifted up her hands from Mount Everwhite* \[RGEO/59\]
:::

### Future

The **future indicative** presents the realization of some action in the future as (virtually) certain (more so than, for example, the 'potential' optative, @@.@@). Depending on the context, the future indicative can be used for various communicative purposes, such as predictions, statements of intention, announcements, promises, threats, suggestions, etc.:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Anar caluva tielyanna"/> *The sun shall shine upon your path* \[UT/22\]
