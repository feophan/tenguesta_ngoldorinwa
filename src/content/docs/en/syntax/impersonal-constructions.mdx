## Introduction

Impersonal verbs have no subject in the normal sense. Such verbs always appear in the **third person singular**. They can be further divided in the following categories:

+ '**Quasi-impersonal**' **verbs**, for which an infinitive or subordinate clause functions as the subject; for details, &rarr; @@ below.
+ '**Proper**' **impersonal verbs**, which have no subject at all. This group is virtually limited to weather terms, expressions of time, and 'impersonal passive' constructions; for details, &rarr;@@ below.

Some proper impersonal verbs do not have a subject, but do take other obligatory constituents, especially in dative.

:::note
English impersonal verbs use the so-called "dummy pronoun" *it*, e.g. *It is raining*. With English quasi-impersonal verbs *it* 'anticipates' the subordinate construction, e.g. *It is clear that he is coming* (cf. *That he is coming is clear*.)

## Quasi-Impersonal Verbs and Constructions

### Verbs

The following common quasi-impersonal verbs take an (accusative-and-) infinitive construction as their subject (&rarr;@@), and frequently also a complement in the dative:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="ecë nin care sa"/> \[VT49/20\] *I can do that*
2. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="orë nin caritas"/> \[VT41/13\] *I feel an urge to do it*

### Adjectives; Nouns

The **singular** of many **adjectives** is used with a third-person singular form of `ná` *be* in quasi-impersonal constructions, taking an (accusative-and-)infinitive construction or `i`-clause. For example:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="ninya ná carita·s"/> *I need to do this*[^fn1]
2. <Tengwar tengwar="       " latin="alasaila ná lá carë tai mo nave mára"/> *it is unwise not to do what one judges good*

Some **nouns** are similarly used in quasi-impersonal constructions. For example:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="     " latin="umbe nin i hríve nauva urra"/> *I have a feeling that winter will be bad*

With such adjectives and nouns <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ná"/> is very often omitted (&rarr;@@):

## Proper Impersonal Verbs and Constructions

### Weather and Time Expressions

Weather verbs such as the following are used impersonally:

+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ule"/> *it rains*
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="nique"/> *it is cold*
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="hrise"/> *it snows*

:::tip[Assumption]
Some expressions of time use an impersonal form of <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ná"/> *be*:

+ <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="(ná) telwa"/> *it is late*
+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="(ná) tensi andúne"/> *it is already sunset*
:::

### Impersonal Passives

Frequently what is translated into English with a passive voice is expressed in Quenya as an impersonal construction:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="⸱" latin="(a)·mate·s"/> \[PE22/107\] *it is eaten*
2. <Tengwar tengwar=" ⸱  " latin="masse akime aldar?"/> \[PE22/125\] *where are the trees (to be found)?*
3. <Tengwar tengwar="    ⸱ " latin="vahaia nóre ëa i a-esta Valinor"/> \[PE22/124\] *far away there is a land called Valinor*

Impersonal passives are made by omitting the subject from the active sentence: the apersonal form of the verb is used with or without a marker <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="a"/> (used to avoid confusion with the infinitive use of apersonal form), which was usually optional in PQ but became more grammaticalized in TQ.

When the impersonal passive[^fn2] is used as an object of infinitive, this <Tengwar tengwar="⸱" latin="a·"/> is however obligatory: 

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   ⸱ " latin="man cenuva lumbor a·hosta?"/> \[MC/222\] *Who shall see the clouds get gathered?*

[^fn1]: Based on the `inya karie·te` \[PE22/123\]
[^fn2]: Whether it is actually passive or not by [WALS](https://wals.info/chapter/107) definition depends on whether `a` can be considered a "special morphological marking of the verb"
