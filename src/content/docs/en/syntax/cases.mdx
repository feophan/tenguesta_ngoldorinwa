## Functions, Meanings and Labels

<Num index={chapter}/> The eight main cases of Quenya (common, genitive-partitive, genitive-adjective, dative, instrumental, locative, ablative and allative) are used in different syntactic functions:

+ to mark **obligatory constituents** with verbs and adjectives (subject, object, complement; here belong also certain uses in constructions like the common-and-infinitive, common-and-participle, etc.);
+ to complement **prepositions**;
+ to mark **attributive modifiers** (the main function of the genitive);
+ to mark various **adverbial modifiers** (here belong also certain uses in constructions like the locative absolute);
+ a few other, idiomatic uses.

In the overview below, the most important uses of each of the cases are listed, organized by syntactic function. The prepositions are treated separately, →@@.

## Common

<Num index={chapter}/> The common case combines functions of historically separate nominative and accusative cases.

### As Nominative for Obligatory Constituent with Verbs

<Num index={chapter}/> The nominative is the case used for the **subject** of a finite verb (and any modifiers that agree with it, →27.7).

**Predicative complements** with **linking verbs** (→26.8) agree with their subject (→27.7), and thus also stand in the nominative.

### Other Uses of Nominative

<Num index={chapter}/> The nominative is used with some most common **prepositions** as there default choice (→31).

The nominative is also used in bare **lists** (→26.29), including entries in dictionaries.

For the nominative used in **apposition to a sentence**, →27.14.

The nominative is also used as a **vocative**: in calls or summonses to attract the attention of a person nearby, or of a god; in addresses, to acknowledge or maintain contact with some person nearby.

:::note
When vocative stands in apposition to a noun, the case of that noun is applied, however.
:::

### As Accusative for Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs)

<Num index={chapter}/> The accusative is the standard case for the **direct object** with verbs which take an object (→26.3).

The following verbs (→26.12) take a direct object and a predicative complement that agrees with that object (and thus also stands in the accusative; this is often called a 'double accusative').

The accusative is also used in the **accusative-and-infinitive** (→51), the **accusative absolute** (→52) and **accusative-and-participle** constructions (→52).

### As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

<Num index={chapter}/> Time **when**, or **within which**, is expressed by either locative or accusative:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="       " latin="umbe nin i hríve nauva urra si loa"/> \[PE22/168\]. *I have a feeling that winter will be bad this year.*

Accusative can also denote the spatial measure (*how long? how broad?*), especially with numerals:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="    ⸱" latin="talion lempe halda ná i·ando"/> \[translated; TAI/150\]. *Five foot high is the door*.

## Genitive

<Num index={chapter}/> The main function of the genitive is at the level of the noun phrase, to mark attributive modifiers (i.e. expressing various relations between (pro)nouns/noun phrases). It is also used to mark some required constituents (complements) with adjectives, and functions in a few adverbial expressions.

Quenya distinguishes two genitival cases: genitive I or **partitive** and genitive II or **adjective**[^gen1].

### As Modifier in a Noun Phrase: the Attributive Genitive

<Num index={chapter}/> The genitive is used particularly within noun phrases, to mark a noun phrase or pronoun as modifier of a head (→26.18). Traditionally, many different categories within this attributive genitive use are distinguished; the most important of these are given below:

+ The **genitive of possession** denotes ownership, belonging, etc.;
+ The **genitive of origin** denotes the origin, offspring, source, etc. of the head;
+ With nouns that express an action ('action nouns', →23.6), the genitive is used for the subject or object of that action — **genitive of the subject** (or 'subjective' genitive) or **of the object** (or 'objective' genitive);
+ Other relations between nouns: material/contents, price/value, elaboration, etc.

<Num index={chapter}/> **Genitive of possession** distinguishes **alienable** (which can be given away or lost) and **inalienable** (perpetual and inherent to the head) possession. Concepts comprising inalienable possession include:

+ body parts: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="rámar aldaron"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="hon maro"/>;
+ part-whole relations: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="tyulma ciryo"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="aicasse Taniquetildo"/>;
+ kinship terms: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="amille Hristo"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" ⸱" latin="indis i·ciryamo"/>;
+ various social relations: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="ingwe ingweron"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="aran zindaron"/>;
+ attributes: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Vorondo voronwe"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="alcar Oromèo"/>;
+ products originating from the head: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="yáve móno"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="óma tário"/>.

Generally these categories are expressed with genitive **partitive**, while the rest — alienable relations — with genitive **adjective**: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Vardava tellumar"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="róma Oroméva"/>.

<Num index={chapter}/> **Genitive of origin** marks the location where the modifier originated from, or its creator (who might not be in its possession), or its author:

+ location: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Calaciryo míri"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Eldar Malariando"/>;
+ creator: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="róma Oromèo"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="⸱ " latin="i·coimas Eldaron"/>.

Genitive of origin is expressed with genitive **partitive**, but its locational function is complementary to **ablative**, particularly if the noun phrase already has a modifier in genitive of another function: <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="menelluin Írildeo Ondolindello"/>.

<Num index={chapter}/> **Genitive of composition** describes the relation between two nouns as a part to its whole:

+ material or substance: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="yuldar miruvóreo"/>;
+ content: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="parma mittarion"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="aure veryanwesto"/>;
+ individual elements: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="yénion yéni"/>;
+ source: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="astali hruo"/>.

<Num index={chapter}/> **Genitive of subject**, marked by genitive I, denotes the subject of a verbal noun: <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Túro matie masta"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="nero carie cirya"/>. Note that the action can sometimes be implicit: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Ráno tie"/> *path of the Moon* ('path *taken* by the Moon').

<Num index={chapter}/> **Genitive of object** (genitive II) describes the affected patient of the action: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Nurtale Valinóreva"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="ciryava carie"/>. Note that **gerund** can take a direct **specific** object in accusative like a verb. In that case, the object **must follow**[^gen2] it: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="carie cirya"/> *making of a (specific) ship*.

#### Determiner Genitive and Descriptive Genitive

<Num index={chapter}/> While the functions listed above are useful, in practice they don't cover a multitude of border cases which we label here as **descriptive**. Most grammars treat it as a homogenous category with only vaguely defined function, but we can distinguish a few categories within it, responsible for **naming**, **comparing** and **describing**:

<Num index={chapter}/> **Classifying genitives** are used to name certain objects, where the dependent clearly restricts the denotation of the head noun: <Tengwar tengwar="⸱ " latin="Nand' Ondoluncava"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="hwesta zindarinwa"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Eruva lisse"/>.

Such genitive is semantically most closely related to adjectives and loose compounds: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="farea nasto"/>, <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="meneldea Eru"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="Ambarmetta"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="Elennanóre"/>. Therefore it typically employs genitive II[^gen4].

<Num index={chapter}/> **Metaphorical Genitive** is used to describe an object, experience, state etc. in terms of another one: <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="yéni únótimë ve rámar aldaron"/>. Structurally these genitives behave like **determiner genitives** from before, but the dependent is very clearly not specific. They do not have the function of a typical determiner (i.e. the referential anchoring of a referent), but rather, they evoke a certain **typical property**.

In contrast to metaphorical genitives, **generic genitives** are not used to compare a referent in terms of another referent (or the referent’s properties) but to describe a specific referent by setting it in relation to **its kind**: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="lambe Eldaron"/>.

#### Genitive II and Loose Compound

:::tip
Essentially, adjective genitive only differs from N + N sequences in containing the marker <Tengwar tengwar="⸱" latin="-va"/>. There are two main factors determining the presence or absence of <Tengwar tengwar="⸱" latin="-va"/> in N + N sequences (given that both allow for a possessive construal), i.e. the **animacy** and the **referentiality** of the dependent.

Adjective genitive still contains some degree of referentiality, in any case more than in expressions with loose compounding. For this reason, <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="rácina [arquenwa macil]"/> is more likely to refer to a specific *knight* than <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="rácina [arquen macil]"/>.

Furthermore, animate dependents are usually realized with the <Tengwar tengwar="‍‍⸱" latin="-va"/>, while inanimate dependents prefer the loose construction. In many cases. however, animacy does not determine categorically whether a genitive or an N + N sequence is used, but rather the statistical preference (i.e. frequency) of the two constructions.
:::

#### Genitive Gradience

<Num index={chapter}/> Gradience in grammar is usually characterized as the phenomenon of blurred boundaries between two categories. When it comes to genitive and the use of genitive I over genitive II, we distinguish two sources for gradience: gradience of the semantic features and gradience as a mismatch in the meaning–form mapping.

Gradience of the semantic features arises from natural ambiguity of some interpretations:

+ <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Eldar Malariando"/> *the elves of (from) Beleriand* \[genitive of origin\] and <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="Eldar Malariandéva"/> *the Beleriand elves* \[classifying genitive\] are for all purposes the same.

The choice then comes as mostly esthetical, but some difference in meaning might still be implied:

+ <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="yuldar miruvóreo"/> *draughts (made) of mead* \[genitive of composition\] and <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="yuldar miruvóreva"/> *mead draughts, draughts sweet like mead* \[classifying or metaphorical genitive\].

Mismatch mapping is a very late phenomenon when Quenya stopped being a colloquial language. It surfaced as a confusion between semantics of genitive I and II and consequent displacement of the latter.

:::tip
As a rule of thumb if you are in an muddy case where it is difficult to decide between genitive I or II, consider whether a dependent is conveying a reference (genitive I) or describing a property (genitive II):

+ <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="octe porceo"/> *an egg of (a specific) chicken*;
+ <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="octe porceva"/> *a chicken egg (and not a duck egg)*.
:::

### As Obligatory Constituent

##### *With Adjectives*

<Num index={chapter}/> The following adjectives (often related in meaning to the verbs regularly taking adverbial modifiers, especially with partitive sense) are complemented by a genitive: 'filled with', 'released from', 'free from', etc.

The **genitive of comparison** is used to complement comparatives:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="arimelda na ilyaron"/> \[PE17/57\]. *She is dearest of all*.

For more details on comparatives and their constructions, →[{CH.S.CMP}](../comparison/).

##### *With Numerals*

<Num index={chapter}/> From <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="nelde"/> *three* onwards, a preceding noun or noun phrase stand in genitive I plural: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="elenion nelde"/> *three stars*. Note that in the late use it was substituted with accusative: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="eleni nelde"/> *three stars*. For details on agreement of numerals, →26.TBD.

##### *As Predicative Complement or Prepositional Complement*

<Num index={chapter}/> Many of the **attributive uses** of the genitive (→30.above) also occur **as predicative complement** with linking verbs.

The **genitive of quality**, used to express a certain characteristic or manner of being,
occurs exclusively in this way:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="neri ú nati nostalèo mare"/> \[translated; PE15/32\][^gen8]. *Men are not beings good by nature*.

Similarly, attributive uses of the genitive may occur after certain prepositions (→31.8):

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="Aina Vende mi Venderon"/> \[VT44/12\]. *Holy Virgin of virgins*.

### As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

<Num index={chapter}/> Sometimes verbs take genitive I in its partitive function to underline **separation**:

+ verbs meaning 'remove from', 'rob of', 'free from' etc.: <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="Varda ortane máryat Oiolosseo"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="lunces macilya vaileo"/>[^gen6];
+ many verbs expressing sensorial or mental processes, to denote **a source** of stimulus: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="hlassenye·s Vardo"/>[^gen5].

:::note
To describe the **direction**, genitive is substituted with **ablative**: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="tentane Melcorello"/>.
:::

Some verbs permit the **genitive of cause** to express the origin or reason for that action: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="síla Ráno"/>[^gen7].

[^gen1]: more commonly labeled in other sources as **possessive** or **possessive-adjective**.

I treat it similarly to <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="mar vanwa tyalien"/> >> <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="mar vanwa tyaliéva"/> vascillation.

[^gen5]: Not attested.
[^gen7]: EQ <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="silmeráno tindon"/>.

## Dative

<Num index={chapter}/> The main function of the dative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers. It is also used to mark some required complements with verbs.

<Icon icon="figures/dative" />

*Figure {chapter}.1: Implication map: dative case of Quenya*

+ **recipient**: <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="ámen anta síra ilaurea massamma"/> \[VT43/12\]. *Give us this day our daily bread*.
+ **benefactor**: <Tengwar tengwar="  ⸱   " latin="sí man i yulma nin enquantuva?"/> \[LotR/377\]. *Who now shall refill the cup for me?*
+ **predicative possessor**: <Tengwar tengwar="     " latin="umbe nin i hríve nauva urra"/> \[PE22/168\]. *I have a feeling that winter will be bad*.
+ **experiencer**: <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="ece nin care sa"/> \[VT49/20\]. *I can do that*.
+ **evaluator**: <Tengwar tengwar="⸱    " latin="i hyarma ú ten ulca símaryassen"/> \[VT49/8\]. *The left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations*.
+ **direction**: <Tengwar tengwar="    " latin="mi cemen raine i hínin"/> \[VT44/34\]. *On earth peace, good will toward men*.
+ **purpose**: <Tengwar tengwar="   ⸱  " latin="vanda sina termaruva Elenna·nóreo alcar enyalien"/> \[UT/305\]. *This oath shall stand in memory of the glory of the Land of the Star*.

### As Obligatory Constituent (to Complement Verbs)

#### As Indirect Object

<Num index={chapter}/> The dative is used to express the indirect object or the **recipient** (Y) with the following types of verbs (X indicates a direct object in the common-accusative, where present):

+ verbs meaning *give*, *entrust*, etc.;
+ verbs meaning *say*, *tell*, *report*, etc. (usually with direct or indirect statement, →41.3);
+ most verbs meaning *command, order, advise* etc. (usually together with an infinitive, →51.8);
+ most verbs meaning *seem*, *appear*, etc.

<Num index={chapter}/> The dative as indirect object, or **experiencer**, complements the following **impersonal verbs** (→36.4-5), usually together with an infinitive (→51.8) (Y marks the dative):

+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ece"/> it is possible for Y (to do something);
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ola"/> Y dreams (of something);
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="h·ore"/> Y feels an urge (to do something);
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="moa"/>[^dat1] Y must (do something);
+ <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="nai"/> it may chance for Y (to do something);	

#### Dative of the Possessor

<Num index={chapter}/> The **dative of the possessor** is used to complement 'existential' <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ná"/> and <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ea"/> (*there is*, →26.10), denoting possession, belonging, or interest. On the difference between this dative and verbs of possession (<Tengwar tengwar="" latin="same"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="harya"/>, etc.), → TBD.

### As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

#### *Referring to Things or Abstract Entities*

<Num index={chapter}/> The dative is very frequently used to express optional adverbial modifiers (→26.14). It marks nouns referring to things or abstract entities in various kinds of adverbial modifiers.

The **dative of cause** expresses reason or cause.

The bare **dative of place** may be used to express the direction whereto action takes place, as a short form of allative:

1.  <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="lendes pallan i sír"/> \[PE17/65\]. *He came to a point far beyond the river*.

#### *Referring to Persons*

<Num index={chapter}/> The **dative of advantage** and **dative of disadvantage** are used to indicate the beneficiary (or opposite) of an action; they express in or against whose interest an action is performed:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="      " latin="Ilu Ilúvatar en cáre eldain a fírimoin"/> \[MQ: LR/63\]. *The Father made the World for Elves and Mortals*.

The dative also marks the person **from whose perspective or vantage point** the action is perceived:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="tulil márie nin"/> \[PE22/158\]. *You come happily for me*.

[^dat1]: unattested.

## Instrumental

<Num index={chapter}/> The main function of the instrumental is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers.

<Icon icon="figures/instrumental" />

*Figure {chapter}.2: Implication map: instrumental case of Quenya*[^ins1]

+ **instrumental**:  <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="antanenyes parmanen"/> \[PE17/91\]. *I presented him with a book*.
+ **material**: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="erulissenen quanta"/> \[VT43/26\]. *Filled with grace*.
+ **manner**: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="norne lintieryanen"/> \[PE17/58-59\]. *He ran as swiftly as he could*.
+ **passive**: <Tengwar tengwar="⸱ " latin="turún' ambartanen"/> \[UT/138\]. *By doom mastered*.
+ **cause**: <Tengwar tengwar="⸱" latin="Eru-indonen"/> \[PE22/165\]. *By the will of God*.
+ **locative**: <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="tintilar i eleni lírinen"/> \[LotR/377\]. *The stars tremble in her voice*.

### As an Optional Constituent (Adverbial Modifier)

<Num index={chapter}/> Instrumental case, as the name implies, most commonly marks the **instrument or means** by which an action is carried out: *built with a hammer*, *painted with a brush*, *fought with fists*.

The **instrumental of material** is closely adjacent to it, and is used to complement transitive verbs and related adjectives to describe the material used in action: *built with stone*, *rich with spoils*, *fraught with sorrows*. Note the difference: *filled with water* (instrumental of material), but *full of water* (genitive of material).

The **instrumental of manner** describes the manner in which an action was carried out, particularly with abstract nouns: *carry with weariness*, *shine with golden light*, *give in measure*[^ins2].

The **instrumental of agent** is used in passive constructions to denote the agent of the action: *executed by the king*, *heard by the audience*, *blamed by the wicked*.

While the instrumental of agent is usually employed for voluntary actions of animate nouns, similar **instrumental of cause** describes the circumstances in which an action happened, sometimes tangentially, and generally can be substituted in gloss with *because of*: *disabled by a wound*, *bent with the sails*[^ins3].

The **instrumental of location** describes location or other intrinsic relations linked to the manner or source of an action, typically of intransitive verbs, and is generally translated with *in, on*: *fall in the wind*, *cloack in veils*, *fluttering on the wings*.

[^ins1]: ["A diachronic dimension in maps of case functions" by Heiko Narrog](https://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/conference/07-SemanticMaps/pdf/narrog.pdf).
[^ins2]: also, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="tanen"/> *in this way* \[VT49/11\].
[^ins3]: also, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="tánen"/> *therefore* \[VT49/11\].

## Locative

<Num index={chapter}/> The main function of the locative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the scene of the action, generally pointing out *where* or *when* the action is happening.

### Spatial Locative

<Num index={chapter}/> The locative describes a **general** spatial relation. We can postulate the basing meaning as[^loc1]:

:::tip[Rule 1]
The **figure** is located close to the **ground**.
:::

The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use of specific spatial adpositions, like <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="mi"/> *in* or <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="to"/> *on* (→ TBD), emphasizes the particulars of the relation and can highlight any deviations from the default assumption, thus serving to cancel unwarranted implicatures:

:::tip[Implication:]
+ The figure is in **contact** with the ground.
+ The figure–ground relation is **canonical**.
+ The ground supports the figure **against gravity**.
:::

The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically: *a plate* is **on** *a table* rather than **under** it, while *an apple* is **in** *a bowl* rather than **at** it.

To provide some examples:

+ the locative conveys the notion of being within a containment:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="       " latin="i fairi néce ringa súmaryasse ve maiwi yaimie"/> \[MC/222\]. *The pale phantoms in her cold bosom like gulls wailing*.

+ it denotes a surface, trodden or touched:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="      " latin="man tiruva rácina cirya ondolisse morne?"/> \[MC/222\]. *Who shall heed a broken ship on the dark rocks?*

+ it signifies the dominion or territory:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Altariello nainie Lóriendesse"/> \[RGEO/58\]. *Galadriel’s lament in Lórien*.

+ and the substance the locus is submerged into:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="nicsi coitar nenesse"/> \[PE22/125\]. *Fish live in water*.

### Locative of Circumstance

<Num index={chapter}/> As the extenstion of this meaning, the locative often denotes the **circumstances**, under which the action comes to pass.

This kind of locative encompasses the **locative of time** as well as the **absolute locative** (TBD). 

#### Locative of Time

<Num index={chapter}/> The locative of time refers to a specific moment or period:

+ **at** which the event happens;
+ **by** which the event should happen.

1. <Tengwar tengwar=" ⸱    ⸱    " latin="qe e·kárie i kirya aldaryas, ni kauva kiryasta menelyas"/> \[MQ: PE22/121\]. *If he finishes the boat* ***by Tuesday***, *I shall be able to sail* ***on Wednesday***.

#### Locative of Respect

<Num index={chapter}/> The locative of respect may denote the **particular point of view** from which a statement is made. This occurs chiefly with adjectives but also with intransitive verbs, and in gloss can be substituted with *with regard to*:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="     " latin="i hyarma ú ten ulca símaryassen"/> \[VT49/6\]. *the left hand was not to them evil in their imaginations*.

Such locative can be used for:

+ parts of the body: *pain in finger, blind in mind, smitten on the neck*;
+ qualities and attributes (nature, form, size, name, birth, number, etc.): *rival in appearance, two leagues in width*;
+ sphere in general: *terrible in battle, good in matters in which he is skilled*.

The instrumental of manner and genitive of quality are often nearly equivalent to the locative of respect: *men are good in nature; men are good by nature; men are of good nature*[^loc2].

#### Locative of Manner

<Num index={chapter}/> With abstract nouns locative of manner can be used periphrasically to describe the state:

1. <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="hara máriesse"/> \[PE17/162\]. *Stay in happiness* (or: *stay happily*)
2. <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="alalye nattira arcandemmar sangiessemman"/> \[VT44/8\]. *Despise not our petitions in our necessities* (or: *done out of necessity*).

### As Obligatory Complement

<Num index={chapter}/> Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in locative case:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Heru órava omesse"/> \[VT44/12\]. *Lord, have mercy on us*.

[^loc1]: Where **figure** is the described noun or action, and **ground** is the locus.
[^loc2]: Such overlap doesn't seem problematic, as it similarly exists in Ancient Greek (Accusative and Dative of Respect), Latin (Ablative and Genitive of Quality) and Sanskrit (Ablative, Instrumental, Genitive and Locative), where those are concurrent idioms.

## Allative

<Num index={chapter}/> The main function of the allative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the goal of the motion, generally pointing out *whither*.

<Icon icon="figures/allative" />

*Figure {chapter}.3: Implication map: allative case of Quenya*

### As a Direction of Movement

<Num index={chapter}/> The allative describes a **general** directional goal of the movement.

The exact position therefore is either not relevant, or easily accessible through context. The use **with** a specific spatial **static** adposition, like <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="nu"/> *under* (→ TBD), emphasizes the particulars:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="lantaner Turcildi nuhuinenna"/> \[LR/47\]. *the Lordly Men fell under shadow*.
2. <Tengwar tengwar="    ⸱" latin="enwina lúme elenillor pella talta-taltala"/> \[MC/222\]. *The old darkness beyond the stars falling*.

The canonicity of the relation is determined pragmatically, and a series of **directional** adpositions are used instead when the context is not complicit:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="   ⸱     " latin="unlunke naiqe yu vaile·na ar elle ha men ambostuva"/> \[EQ: PE16/146\]. *He pulled his sword from the sheath and drove it into the breast*.

To provide some canonic examples:

+ the allative describes the motion **into a containment**:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="eari ullier i kilyanna"/> \[LR/47\]. *The seas poured into the chasm*.

+ it denotes a **surface** a movement is directed towards and comes into direct contact with:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Anar caluva tielyanna"/> \[UT/22\]. *The sun shall shine upon your path*.

+ it signifies **entered dominion or territory**:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien"/> \[LotR/967\]. *Out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth have I come*.

+ and generally **the end point of a movement** or **intended destination**:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="hríve úva véna"/> \[PE22/167\]. *Winter is drawing near to us*.
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="   ⸱ " latin="quiquie menin coaryanna, arse"/> \[VT49/24\]. *Whenever I arrive at his house, he is out*.

+ as well as the **target of aim**:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="     " latin="ar cé mo formenna tentanes Amanna"/> \[VT49/8\]. *And if (one turned face) northwards, it (left hand) pointed towards Aman*.

:::caution
Allative profiles the goal as the **intended destination**, but it does not specify whether this goal is reached or whether an agent is somewhere on the way. However, if the direction is **not** the goal, the allative cannot be used. To describe the directionality of the path, the adposition <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="na"/> *towards* is employed instead[^all1]. 
:::

### Allative of Time

<Num index={chapter}/> In the domain of time, the use of the allative is restricted to those expressions where both the starting point and the endpoint are mentioned. For instance, if we want to say 'from Monday to Friday', we will use the allative as in <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="izilyallo valanyanna"/>, but if we just want to mention the endpoint, the use of the allative is not allowed; instead, the adposition <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="tenna"/> *until* is used. Therefore, *until tomorrow* is translated as <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="tenna enar"/>[^all3].

### Allative of Purpose

:::tip[Assumption]
Extending the meaning of direction, allative also signifies the **purpose** of the action, following a frequent conceptualization: <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">causes are origins of events</span>, and <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">purposes are destinations</span>: *let's go looking* ***for food***[^all2].
:::

For the use of allative of purpose in periphrasic future construction → TBD.

#### Allative as Translative

:::tip[Assumption]
Verbs of change like <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="óla"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="virya"/>, <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="ahya"/> take allative to describe a final **state** or **result**: *he turned into a great scholar*.
:::

### Allative of Extent

<Num index={chapter}/> Similar to instrumental, allative can describe *how* an action was carried out, answering a question **to what extent? to what degree?**

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="a laita tárienna"/> \[LotR/953\]. *Praise (them) to the height*.

### As Obligatory Complement

#### As Direct Object

<Num index={chapter}/> Some verbs take what might be a direct object in other languages as a complement in allative case:

1. <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="verya senna"/> \[VT49/45\]. *I married her*.
2. <Tengwar tengwar="⸱  " latin="Tar-Calion octacáre Valannar"/> \[LR/47\]. *Tar-Kalion warred the Powers*.

#### As Indirect Object

<Num index={chapter}/> Generally, dative denoting a recipient can be freely substituted for allative:

1. <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="antane ninna"/> \[PE17/147\]. *He gave it to me*.
2. <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="sin quentë Quendingoldo Elendilenna"/> \[PM/401\]. *Thus Pengolodh said to Elendil*.

[^all1]: [PE21/79]. More on difference between allative and directive can be found in ["Polysemy in Basque Locational Cases" by Iraide Ibarretxe-Antuñano](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233650860_Polysemy_in_Basque_Locational_Cases).
[^all2]: ortírielyanna rucimme might be an example of such function ("we flee *for your protection*"), and the use of ruce with ablative to denote the <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">cause</span> of fear does give some credibility to it. However, the Latin original *Sub tuum praesidium confugimus* has a metaphorical spatial sense 'under', hence the example cannot serve as a solid confirmation of such usage. But for typological and pragmatical reasons, as well as (weak) additional support by <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">future</span> function, we suggest to keep it.
[^all3]: Neither ablative nor allative are attested in temporal domain, but: "<Tengwar tengwar="" latin="na"/> *to, towards, of space/****time***" \[PE17/147\].

## Ablative

<Num index={chapter}/> The main function of the ablative is to mark non-obligatory (adverbial) modifiers describing the source of the motion, generally pointing out *whence*, and is therefore the very **opposite of allative**.

### As a Direction of Movement

<Num index={chapter}/> The ablative, then, is wanted to express **from what place** there is a starting and moving:

+ in its proper sense, movement **away from**: 
	
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="métima hrestallo círa"/> *leave the last shore* \[MC/221\];

+ movement **out of** a container, often accompanied with a preposition <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="et"/>:
	
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Melko Mardello lende"/> *Melko has gone from Earth* \[MQ: LR/72\]
	+ <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="et Eärello Endorenna utúlien"/> *out of the Great Sea to Middle-earth I have come* \[LotR/967\];

+ **starting point** of movement:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="  ⸱" latin="elenillor pella talta-taltala"/> *beyond stars falling* \[MC/222\]

+ **pointing, aiming** away from:

	+ <Tengwar tengwar="   " latin="i hyarma tentane Melkorello"/> *the left hand pointed away from Melkor* \[VT49/6\];

:::tip[Assumption]
+ *moving off* a surface;
+ *to see, hear, speak* etc *from* a spot;
:::

:::caution
Verbs of **separation** from the whole take genitive I: <Tengwar tengwar="⸱   " latin="n·alalmino hyá lanta lasse"/> *from the elm-tree here a leaf falls* \[EQ:VT40/8\].
:::

### Ablative of Source, Origin and Cause

<Num index={chapter}/> In a more abstract sense with verbs of:

+ *taking, receiving from*: <Tengwar tengwar=" " latin="yello camnelyes"/> *from whom you received him* \[VT47/21\];
+ *protecting, guarding, securing from*: <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="áme etelehta ulcullo"/> *deliver us from evil* \[VT43/12\];
+ *being afraid of* \[VT44/7\]; 

:::tip[Assumption]
+ *asking, wishing, learning from*;
+ *restraining, preventing, excluding from*;
:::

:::note
Ablative of origin can also be used as an attributive modifier: <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="Menelluin Írildeo Ondolindello"/> *Cornflower of Idril from Gondolin* \[TAI/193\], <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="fanwen tollillon lómealloi"/> *a dream from the gloomy islands* \[PE16/147\]. Genitive I is more common in this role, however.
:::

:::tip[Assumption]
From a common interpretation <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">causes are origins of events</span> arises the ablative of cause, describing the **cause, reason, motive by which** an action or an event came to be[^abl2].
:::

### Ablative of Time

<Num index={chapter}/> When denoting time, the ablative carries the meaning of **from, since, after**. Commonly it is attended by prepositions, as <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="et"/>: <Tengwar tengwar="     ⸱ " latin="et sillumello ter yénion yéni tenn' ambarmetta"/> *from this hour, through years of years until the ending of the world* \[VT44/33\], but it is possible to go with single ablative[^abl1].

#### Ablative as Exessive

:::tip[Assumption]
As the opposite of translative, exessive denotes the *former state* or *shape*, out of which some other state or shape proceeds or is produced.
:::

### As Obligatory Complement

#### As Indirect Object

<Num index={chapter}/> A few special verbs take second (indirect) object in ablative:

1. <Tengwar tengwar="  " latin="ávatyara mello roctammar"/> \[VT43/11\]. *Forgive us our trespasses*.

[^abl2]: Not attested. But <Tengwar tengwar="" latin="etta"/>, unless discarded, plays into conceptualization.
[^abl1]: Typologically, but not attested.
