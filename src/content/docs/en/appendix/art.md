title: Definite Article of Quenya
---

The goal of this chapter is to explain the various asymmetries with regard to the (non-)use of definite articles in Quenya as compared to English. For that we will exploit the distinction of semantic and pragmatic uniqueness as originally introduced by Löbner[^1] and some generalizations made by Ortmann[^2] and Schwarz[^4] over weak-strong article splits encountered in many languages.

## Nominal Concept Types

In his theory Löbner proposes a lexical distinction of noun types in how they classify the universe:

+ \[-R\] nouns point to a member of a class: *rock, architect, chair*;
+ \[+R\] nouns require a \[-R\] noun to bound them to the scene: *wheel, sister, head*;
+ \[-U\] nouns might have several instances within the same scene: *tree, brother, minister*;
+ \[+U\] nouns pick out a unique memeber within the scene: *Peter, weather, father*.

Lexical units have their default combination \[±U\]\[±R\], but virtually each of them can undergo a type shift into any other combination:

+ \[-U\] &rarr; \[+U\]: *a rock* &rarr; *the rock*;
+ \[+U\] &rarr; \[-U\]: *the mother of a child* &rarr; *a late mother*;
+ \[-R\] &rarr; \[+R\]: *a book* &rarr; *my book*;
+ \[+R\] &rarr; \[-R\]: *the king of Spain* &rarr; *a king*.

Nouns which interpretation coincides with their lexical combination are then called *nouns* of this type, and which interpretation diverges from that combination are then called *concepts* of this type. The four possible types are then called: 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th></th>
		<th>[-U]</th>
		<th>[+U]</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>[-R]</th>
		<td>sortal</td>
		<td>individual</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>[+R]</th>
		<td>relational</td>
		<td>functional</td>
	</tr>
</table>

:::note
The terminology distinguishes the noun's *underlying type* (eg. *functional noun*, FN) from its *actual use* (eg. *functional concept*, FC).

## Semantic vs Pragmatic Uniqueness

It is crucial then to distinguish between individual and functional *nouns* on one hand which are lexically unique, and *concepts* which uniqueness results from the context (linguistic or extra-linguistic). In his work Ortmann claims that this distinction results in the fundamental split of the article use: concepts are marked in a more explicit way. It's especially easy to obseve such tendency in languages which show two types of definite articles &mdash; weak and strong &mdash; like German.

The matter is not only complicated by the fact that articles tend to invade into other categories[^5], but also by fuzzy cases which could be analyzed either as semantic or pragmatic. The latter especially results in the article variation in closely related languages.

### Strong Article in Quenya

The first major difference we can point between Quenya and English is the (non-)use of the article with unique nouns, where it is logically redundant:

|	type	|	Quenya	|	English	|
|	----	|	----	|	----	|
|	SN	|	antanen **hatal**	|	I cast **a spear**	|
|	RN	|	&mdash;	|	&mdash;	|
|	IN	|	**anar** caluva	|	**the sun** shall shine	|
|	FN	|	**lambe** Eldaiva	|	**the language** of the Eldar	|

However, it occurs with unique concepts to mark the incongruence:

|	type	|	Quenya	|	English	|
|	----	|	----	|	----	|
|	IC	|	á sac' **i fendë**	|	close **the door** |
|	FC	|	**i yávë** mónalyo |	**the fruit** of thy womb	|

:::note
Many languages diverge here from the Ortmann's statement where Quenya adheres to it: they use the weak (semantic) article in the *immediate use* IC like in the sentence above. Schwarz shows that the weak article is used without anaphoricity. The immediate use IC is pragmatic but non-anaphoric. Löbner's and Ortmann's uniqueness scale avoids to include immediate use IC altogether.

## The Threshold of Semantic and Pragmatic Uniqueness

Some corner cases which don't clearly belong either to semantic or pragmatic uniqueness are:

+ Bridging: "John bought *a book* today. **The author** is French".
+ Autophoric nouns: "He bought **the car** *that was shown on TV*".
+ Non-lexical FC: "**The highest** *mountain*".

### Non-Lexical Functional Concepts

**Non-lexical FC** is a concept where semantic uniqueness comes about by **syntactic** structure and semantic **composition** rather than by the lexical meaning of the head noun. In particular, these are nouns combined **with ordinal numbers**, and **with superlative** forms of attributive adjectives. In these cases uniqueness is achieved by the lexical meaning of the *modifier*.

#### Complex FC in Quenya

Quenya superlative adjectives do **not** take the article[^sup], and  neither do the determining adjectives like *last, next, only, same*:

+ `métima hrestallo círa` \[MC/221\] *leave the last shore*

While no canonical example of ordinal number with a noun exists, they belong to the same category, and it is expected to observe a lack of the article with them too. 

### Bridging

Bridging or 'definite associative anaphora' (DAA) describes a noun, typically a functional noun, which is uniquely defined by its relation to a previously mentioned noun:

+ I looked into *the room*. **The ceiling** was very high
+ *My new car* needed repairing, **the motor** was broken
+ I've just been to *a wedding*. **The bride** wore blue.

Based on the world knowledge, the hearer knows that at a wedding, there should be one and only one bride, a room has only one ceiling and a car needs a motor. DAAs combine properties of pragmatic uniqueness (by virtue of anaphoricity) and semantic uniqueness (by virtue of involving a FN). It is therefore natural for there to be considerable variation in the use of articles.

#### DAA in Quenya

There's no canonical example of DAA in the current corpus of Quenya, but two sentences are close approximations to such:

+ `alcar mi Tarmenel na Erun ar mi cemen rainë i hínin` \[VT44/32\]. *Glory to God in the highest and on earth peace, good will toward men*. 'The children' is definite in the reference to Eru.
+ `an cé mo quernë cendelë númenna, i hyarma tentanë Melcorello` \[VT49/6-8\]. *For if one turned the face westward, the left hand pointed away from Melkor*. 'The left hand' is definite in the reference to *one*.

:::note
The first example *Eru &rarr; the children* is a 'relational anaphora', and the second example *one &rarr; the left hand* is 'part-whole' DAA. Even though Schwarz and Ortmann discuss how part-whole and maker-product DAAs differ in their semantic-pragmatic dichotomy in some languages, the examples above show that in Quenya **any** DAA is marked by the article.
:::

### Autophoric Nouns

Autophoric nouns establish their unique reference by a restrictive relative clause. Context-dependency affects the weak-strong article choice, but it seems Quenya in general requires an article uniformly (even when the relative clause is reduced) unless superceded by another determiner:

+ `Átaremma i ea han Ea` \[VT43/12\] *our Father who art in Heaven*
+ `manar i·ennor i me·kenner` \[MQ: PE22/124\] *who are the persons that we saw?* 
+ `caita mornie i falmalinnar imbe met` \[RGEO/58\] *darkness lies on the foaming waves between us*

## Quenya as a Split I System

The simplified scale of uniqueness suggested by Löbner and Ortmann:

> *deictic SN* < *anaphoric SN* < *autophoric SN* < *DAA* < *non-lexical IC, FC* < *IN, FN* < *proper names*

where the cut-off position for the article use varies from language to language:

+ English: *deictic SN* < \[*anaphoric SN* < *autophoric SN* < *DAA* < *non-lexical IC, FC* < *IN, FN*\] < *proper names* 
+ Quenya: *deictic SN* < \[*anaphoric SN* < *autophoric SN* < *DAA*\] < *non-lexical IC, FC* < *IN, FN* < *proper names*
