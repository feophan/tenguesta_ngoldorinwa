## Basic Categories and Elements

### Categories of the Verb

#### Finite versus Non-finite Verb Forms

Quenya verb forms are either **finite** (indicatives, subjunctives, optatives, imperatives) or **non-finite** (gerunds, infinitives, participles, and verbal adjectives in `-nwa`, `-ite` or `-ima`). Finite verbs can have a personal ending (@@) and express person or number, and can be modified by mood particles; nonfinite verbs do not have a personal ending and do not express person or mood.

#### Categories Pertaining to All Verb Forms: Tense-Aspect

All Quenya verb forms, i.e. both finite and non-finite forms (only participles), are marked for the category of **tense-aspect**.

**Tense-aspect**: Quenya verb forms fall into three overarching systems, depending on which stem of the verb is used (@@); these three systems differ primarily in their expression of aspect:

+ the **aorist-stem system**, covering the aorist, the preterite, the future;
+ the **present-stem system**, covering the present, the imperfect, present active and passive participles;
+ and the **perfect-stem system**, covering the perfect, the pluperfect, the past active and passive participles.

Within these systems, **tense** is expressed by all forms. **Aspect** is not expressed by participles.

#### Categories Pertaining to Finite Verb Forms

All finite verb forms, in addition to belonging to one of the three tense-aspect systems, are also marked for the categories of **person** and **number**, and the category of **mood**.

Finite verb forms express one of the following **persons**:

+ **apersonal form** (used with expressed subject, @@);
+ **first person** ('I'/'we (but not you)'/'we (with you)');
+ **second person** ('you');
+ or **third person**('he/she'/'it', 'they');

And they express one of the following **numbers**:

+ **singular** ('I', 'you', 'he/she'/'it');
+ **plural** ('we (but not you)'/'we (with you)', 'you', 'they');
+ in addition, Quenya has a **dual number** ('you and I', 'you two','the two of them', @@).

Finite verb forms do not express **moods**, and those are realized as mood particles preceeding the verb (for the uses and meanings of these moods, @@). The following moods are recongnized:

+ **indicative**;
+ **subjunctive**;
+ **optative**;
+ **imperative**.

Finally, indicative forms can be split into **basic forms** (aorist, present, preterite, perfect, future) and **derivative forms** (imperfect, future perfect, future imperfect, long perfect (perfect continuous), pluperfect, future-in-the-past).

:::danger[Controversial]
Derivative forms are extremely rare and should be avoided.
:::

#### Categories Pertaining to Non-finite Verb Forms

Non-finite verb forms are marked for the following categories:

+ **Infinitives** are not marked for any category;
+ **Gerunds** are marked for case;
+ **Participles** express tense and voice, and, like adjectives, are also marked for the categories of case and number (→ @@);
+ **Verbal adjectives** are only marked for the categories of case, number and voice.

**Voice**: all Quenya participle forms also express voice, treated in detail in @@. A basic two way distinction between different kinds of forms may be made:

+ **active** forms;
+ and **passive** forms.

### Morphological Building Blocks: Stems, Endings, and Other Markings

#### Verb Stems and Tense-Aspect Stems

All forms of a certain verb share a **verb stem**, which identifies the forms as deriving from that particular verb: for example, in any form of the verb `talta` (e.g. `atalantiemma`, `taltuvante`, `talanter`), the verb stem `talat-` identifies the form as belonging to that particular verb (and thus expressing in some way the meaning *fall*).

Many Quenya verb stems occur in different variants due to ablaut vowel gradation (→ @@): for example, the verb stem of the verb `ortä` *rise* occurs as either `ort-` (zero grade), `orot-` (short grade) or `ór-` (lengthened grade). Different tense-aspect stems of such verbs differ in the vowel-grade they show.

For verbs which have variant verb stems, all variants are given below, where required.

Through the addition of endings, augments and ablaut, a **tense-aspect stem** is formed. The tense-aspect stem identifies the form as having a particular combination of tense-aspect.

Six different kinds of tense-aspect stems may be distinguished; these fall into the three overarching systems described above (@@):

+ aorist tense-aspect: aorist stems, past stems, future stems;
+ present tense-aspect: present stems, imperfect stems;
+ perfect tense-aspect: perfect stems.

The mechanisms involved in forming tense-aspect stems from verb stems are detailed in the individual chapters on the present (→ @@), aorist (→ @@), and perfect (→ @@) stems.

Verbs lacking certain tense-aspect stems altogether are called **defective verbs**: for instance, the verb `lir-` *sing* lacks past-stem forms in classical Quenya, and verbs in `-ea` have no present forms at all.

#### Thematic Vowels

Some elements appear **between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect stem ending**:

+ Many Quenya verb forms include a **thematic vowel** (or: 'theme vowel') `a` standing between the stem and the ending, e.g. <code>ort<b>a</b>uva</code>, <code>hent<b>a</b>nie</code>; for details, @@ below.

#### Endings

Every verb form also has an **ending**, which provides the information required to identify the form as either finite or non-finite, and sometimes its voice, tense, aspect or mood. These endings are called **primary**.

:::note
Most often such an ending is referred to as a **suffix**, but here this term is reserved for a derivative block of a new lexeme. By this definition, the derivational morphology of verbal adjectives, participles and gerunds like `-itë` is a *suffix*, but preterite `-ne` is a *primary ending*. However, for simplicity (particularly due to cases like future participle, where derivational suffix follows its primary ending), they are all discussed under the title of verbal endings.
:::

Some verbal forms can express additional information in their **secondary ending**:

+ For finite verbs, the 'personal ending' expresses person and number;
+ For infinitive, the 'possessive ending' also expresses person and number;
+ The endings of gerund, participles and verbal adjectives might express case and number.

The endings are treated more fully below, → @@.

#### Augments and Prepositional Prefixes

Finally, some elements precede the stem:

+ perfect stems might include an augment, which takes the form of a **root vowel**[^app1] directly preceding the stem (e.g. `e-cénie`), or, if the verb stem begins with a vowel, either that vowel is lengthened (e.g. `úlie`) or the syllable is duplicated (`orórie`). For details, → @@.
+ Many compound verbs begin with a prepositional prefix, an original preposition integrated into the verb form, e.g. `ettulë`, `aucirë` (→ @@). These prefixes are always the first element of a form, preceding even augments and reduplications (→ @@).

A final consonant of such prefixes often assimilates to the following sound: e.g. `eccezë` but `etecézie` (→ @@).

:::tip[Assumption]
If the prefix ends in a vowel, this vowel usually drops out before another vowel (elision, → @@).
:::

:::note
For reduplications, → @@.

## Verbal Stems

Quenya verbal stems split into seven major groups or **conjugations**:

1. **basic verbs**: most numerous group of bare primitive <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal</span> shape: `cen-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;ken</span>) *see*, `tul-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tul</span>) *come*, `mat-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;mat</span>) *eat*;
2. **long verbs**: triconsonantal verbs of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;talat</span> shape: `talat-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;talat</span>) *fall*, `carap-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;karap</span>) *speak*, `sulup-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;sulup</span>) *drink*;
3. **vocalic-progressive** or **a-verbs**: verbs with an inherently continuative sense of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ā</span> shape: `'ala-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;gal-ā</span>) *grow*, `fara-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;spar-ā</span>) *hunt*, `hora-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;skor-ā</span>) *wait*;
4. **vocalic-inceptive** or **u-verbs**: verbs often with an inherently inchoactive sense of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ū</span> shape (with or without a consonantal element): `haru-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;khad-ū</span>) *sit down*, `liru-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;lir-ū</span>) *sing*, `cainu-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kaj-nū</span>) *lie down*;
5. **formative verbs**: verbs that add an additional consonant to the stem, usually of inchoactive or anticausative meaning, of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-t</span>, <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-j</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-s</span> shape: `cait-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kaj-t</span>) *lie*, `siry-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;sir-j</span>) *flow*, `cals-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kal-s</span>) *shine*;
6. **causative verbs**: verbs with an inherently causative meaning that add an additional syllable to the stem of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ta</span> or <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tal-ja</span> shape: `caita-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;kaj-ta</span>) *lay*, `tulta-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tul-ta</span>) *send*, `tulya-` (<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tul-ja</span>) *lead*;
7. **derivative verbs**: verbs formed from nouns or adjectives, with or without addition of derivative elements: `tengua-` *read* (from `tengua` *letter*), `remba-` *trap* (from `rembe` *net*), `telconta-` *stride* (from `telco` *leg*).

Together conjugations 2-7 are known as **secondary verbs**.

## Thematic and Athematic Conjugations

Quenya verb forms are either thematic or athematic. Thematic forms include a thematic vowel `a` between the verb-stem and the non-finite or tense-aspect ending. Athematic forms do not include a thematic vowel: thus in athematic forms tense-aspect ending is attached immediately to the stem:

|	class	|	aorist	|	preterite	|	future	|	present	|	perfect	|
|	----	|	----	|	----	|	----	|	----	|	----	|
|	I	|	A	|	A	|	A	|	A	|	A	|
|	II	|	T	|	A	|	A	|	A	|	A	|
|	III	|	T	|	T	|	A	|	A	|	A	|
|	IV	|	A	|	A	|	A	|	A	|	A	|
|	V	|	T	|	A	|	A	|	A	|	A	|
|	VI	|	T	|	T	|	T	|	T	|	T	|
|	VII	|	T	|	T	|	A	|	T	|	T	|
	
Some examples with a III conjugation verb with a stem `far-` *hunt*:

+ `faran`: 1 sg. aor. thematic: thematic vowel `a` stands between the ending `-n` and the aorist-stem;
+ `fáran`: 1 sg. pres. athematic: the tense-aspect ending `a` is a part of the present-stem;
+ `faranen`: 1 sg. pret. thematic: thematic vowel `a` stands between the verb-stem and the tense-aspect ending `-ne`;
+ `faruvan`: 1 sg. fut. athematic: the tense-aspect ending `-uva` is attached to the verb-stem directly;
+ `faráve`: ger. thematic: thematic vowel `a` is inserted before the gerundial ending;
+ `farita`: inf. athematic: the infinitive ending `-ita` is attached directly to the verb-stem.

:::tip[Assumption]
No infinitive form but of basic verbs is attested.

## Endings

### Endings of Finite Forms

The endings of finite verb forms are divided into **primary**, which mark tense-aspect, and **secondary** or 'personal' which mark person and number of its subject.

#### Primary Endings

**Tense-Aspect Endings**

|	aorist	|	present	|	preterite	|	perfect	|	future	|
|	---	|	---	|	---	|	---	|	---	|
|	-*(ë)*	|	-*(y)a*	|	-*(n)e*	|	-*(n)ie*	|	-*uva*	|

More details in @@.

**Imperative Ending**

:::caution[TODO]
+ [ ] Add section on imperative -á
:::

#### Personal Endings

The (a)personal endings of finite verb forms are the same for all stems:

+ Apersonal endings mark only **number**, and they are used when the subject of the verb is **explicit**;
+ Personal endings mark **number and person** when the subject is left **implicit**;
+ In singular personal endings can be either short or long depending on euphonic environment.

### Endings of Non-finite Forms

#### Primary Endings

|	infinitive	|	gerund	|	active participle	|	passive participle	|
|	---	|	---	|	---	|	---	|
|	-ita	|	-ie, -ve	|	-(i)la	|	-(i)na	|

:::note
Participles express tense and therefore employ primary endings of **both finite and non-finite forms**: `car-uva-ila` *that will be doing*. They are not marked for aspect, however, so **perfect** ending is used for **past tense**, **aorist** ending for **present tense**.
:::

More details in @@.

#### Possessive Endings

Even though non-finite forms don't use secondary 'personal' endings to denote subject like finite forms do, they nonetheless can express it with substantive **'possessive' endings** (→@@): `caritalya·s` *your doing it*. For details, @@.

#### Nominal Endings

Gerund and participles function as nouns and therefore can receive a **case ending**. Gerund declines as a second-declension noun (→[4.@@](nou.md#sdn)), and participles as a first-declension noun (→[4.@@](nou.md#fdna)).

## Augments and Reduplications

### Formation of the Augment

Perfect-stem forms (though, not only) normally include an augment, which immediately precedes the stem. The form of the augment is determined by the initial sound of the (tense-aspect) stem.

##### With Stems Beginning with a Consonant

If the stem begins with a consonant, the augment takes the form of a **root vowel**:

|	verbal stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	mat-		| 	a-mátie			|
|	tul-		| 	u-túlie			|
|	h·or-		|	o-hórie			|

With stems beginning with strong `n`, `m`, `ng`[^aar1] (→@@), that strong consonant is restored:

|	verbal stem	|	aorist stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---			|	---				|
|	ndac-		| 	nacë	|	a-ndácie			|
|	mbar-		| 	marë	|	a-mbárie			|
|	ngor-		|	ngorë	|	o-ngórie			|

:::note[Late Tarquesta]
Eventually those forms were brought into line with aorist stems: `nacë` > `anácie`, `marë` > `amárie`. As `ng-` became `n-`, it appeared as such: `norë` > `onórie`.
:::

[^aar1]: The difference is more obvious in transcription schemas that use `ñ-` for initial *ngoldo*: `ñorë` > `ongórie`.

##### With Stems Beginning with a Vowel or Diphthong

If the stem begins with a vowel, the augment usually gets absorbed into it with the lengthening (and in lengthened-grade ablaut it disappears):

|	verbal stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	ap-			| 	a-ápie > ápie	|
|	ef-			| 	e-éfie > éfie	|
|	ul-			|	u-úlie > úlie	|

It is also common for some verbs (and more generally in verse) to use reduplication instead (see below, @@):

### Formation of Reduplications

Frequentative and sometimes perfect stems are formed by the addition of a reduplication to the verb stem. Reduplications consist of a consonant + root vowel, and may substitute an augment with stems starting with a vowel.

##### Three Types of Reduplication

With verb stems beginning

+ with a single consonant, `ty-` or `qu-`,
+ strong nasals (`nd-`, `mb-`, `ng-`), or other palatilized consonants (`ny-`, `ly-`[^for1], `j-`):

**reduplication = initial consonant + root vowel**:

|	verbal stem	|	frequentative stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	sil-		| 	sisilla			|
|	tyal-		| 	tyatyalla		|
|	ndac-		|	nandacca		|
|	nyar-		|	nanyarra		|
|	jam-		|	hajamma			|

With verb stems beginning

+ with a combination of stop + `s` (`cs-`, `ps-`, `ts-`),
+ voiceless liquid (`hl-`, `hr-`):

**reduplication = second consonant + root vowel**:

|	verbal stem	|	frequentative stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	psar-		| 	sapsarra		|
|	csar-		|	sacsarra		|
|	hlas-		| 	lahlassa		|
|	hris-		|	rihrissa		|

With verb stems beginning

+ with a vowel:

**reduplication = root vowel + final consonant**:

|	verbal stem	|	perfect stem	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	is-t-		| 	is-ísie			|
|	ol-			| 	ol-ólie			|
|	or-y-		|	or-órie			|

##### Further Particulars

Verbal roots of <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">&Sqrt;tā</span> shape frequently show **inversion**. When this happens, augment and reduplication follow regular 'consonant-first' form:

|	verbal stem	|	stem with augment	|
|	---			|	---				|
|	au-t- < wā-t| 	a-wá-nie		|
|	is-t- < sī-t| 	i-si-nte		|
|	or-y- < rō-j|	o-ro-nte		| 

### The Relative Position of Augments, Reduplications and Prefixes

##### Basic Rules

:::tip[Rule]
In compound verbs that include a prepositional prefix, any augment or reduplication comes after the prefix: `entul-` > `en-u-túlie`.
:::

[^for1]: If `gy-` > `ly-`, something to sort later.
