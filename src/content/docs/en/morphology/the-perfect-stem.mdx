### Ablaut in Perfect Stems

Perfect stem is formed from a verb stem with either a zero- or lengthened-grade ablaut:

+ **zero-grade**: causative and derivative verbs;
+ **lengthened-grade**: basic verbs, a-verbs, u-verbs, and formative verbs.

:::caution[Exception]
Long verbs make their perfect tense stem with **short-grade** ablaut, see below.
:::

:::note[Reminder]
Derivative and causative conjugations have **only zero-grade** stem (→@@).

Long conjugations have **no lengthened-grade** stem.
:::

### Thematic and Athematic Perfects

Forms built on the perfect stem follow either a thematic or an athematic conjugation.

+ **thematic** conjugation: derivative and causative verbs.
+ **athematic** conjugation: all other verbs.

### Tense Endings

Tense endings are added after a theme vowel in thematic conjugations, or directly to stem in athematic conjugations.

+ thematic ending: `-nie`, also in long verbs; 
+ athematic ending: `-ie`. 

### Overview of Regular Forms

Examples (lengthened-grade ablaut stems and thematic vowels are highlighted):

|	vocalic u	|	lir-u-	|	i-**lír**-u-ie	|
|	long	|	talat-	|	a-**talat**-nie > atalantie	|
|	formative (a)	|	sir-y-	|	i-**sír**-y-ie > isírie	|

|	causative (b)	|	tul-ta-	|	u-tul-t-*a*-nie	|

:::note[Late Tarquesta]
Since in lengthened-grade stems formatives (a) and (b) have essentially the same form, the alternative **short-grade** forms developped to distinguish them: `is-t-` > `isi-t-nie` > `isintie`.
